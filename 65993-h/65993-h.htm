  <h2 class='c003'>FOREWORD FOR INSTRUCTOR.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>[<i>N.B.&mdash;Remarks printed in italics are, throughout the
book, addressed to the Instructor.</i>]</p>

<p class='c007'><i>By the term "Instructor" I mean any man or lad
who takes up the training of either a Patrol</i> (i.e., <i>six to
eight boys</i>), <i>or a Troop</i> i.e., (<i>several Patrols joined together</i>).</p>

<p class='c005'><i>By means of this book I hope that anyone, even without
previous knowledge of scouting, may be able to teach
it to boys&mdash;in town just as well as in the country.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>The system is applicable to existing organisations
such as schools, boys' brigades, cadet corps, etc., or
can supply a simple organisation of its own where these
do not exist. But in all cases I would strongly commend
the "Patrol" system: that is, small permanent
groups, each under responsible charge of a leading boy,
as the great step to success.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>The reasons for this, the objects of the training and
full hints to Instructors I have already published in a
pamphlet called "The Boy Scouts Scheme." Price
Twopence. Published by Bradbury, Agnew, Bouverie
Street, London, E.C. They will be further set forth in
Part VI. of the present book.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>I recommend the Instructor to begin with a Patrol of
eight boys if possible, and when these have qualified as
"First-class Scouts" to select the best five or six to
raise each a patrol of his own and instruct it under his
(the Instructor's) supervision.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span><i>A great step is to obtain, if possible, a room, barn, or
school to serve as a Club, especially for work on long
winter evenings. It must be well-lit and warmed. And
to have a camp-out in the summer.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>There need be no great expense in working a troop of
Boy Scouts.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>Finance must largely depend on the efforts of the
Scouts themselves. Methods for making money will be
indicated in <a href='#part4'>Part IV</a>. I do not hold with begging for
funds if it can possibly be avoided.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>Any further information or advice will readily be
given on application, and I shall be glad to have any suggestions
or informal reports of progress and numbers
trained. But I have no desire to trouble
Instructors with red-tape returns, and so on.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>Scouts' Badges, Medals, Patrol Flags, and Crests,
Tracking Irons, and such articles of scouts' equipment,
can be obtained at low rates on application here.</i></p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>
  <h4 class='c013'>CAMP FIRE YARN.&mdash;No. 1. <br /> MAFEKING BOY SCOUTS.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c004'>We had an example of how useful Boy Scouts can be
on active service, when a corps of boys was formed in
the defence of Mafeking, 1899-1900.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mafeking, you may remember, was quite a small
ordinary country town out on the open plains of South
Africa.</p>

<p class='c005'>Nobody ever thought of its being attacked by an
enemy any more than you would expect this town (or
village) to be attacked&mdash;the thing was so improbable.</p>

<p class='c005'>But it just shows you how you must be prepared for
what is <i>possible</i>, not only what is <i>probable</i> in war; and
so, too, we ought to be prepared in Britain against
being attacked by enemies; for though it may not be
probable, it is quite as possible as it was at Mafeking;
and every boy in Britain should be just as ready as
those boys were in Mafeking to take their share in its
defence.</p>

<p class='c005'>Well, when we found we were to be attacked at
Mafeking, we told off our garrison to the points that
they were to protect&mdash;some 700 trained men, police, and
volunteers. And then we armed the townsmen, of
whom there were some 300. Some of them were old
frontiersmen, and quite equal to the occasion; but many
of them, young shopmen, clerks, and others, had never
seen a rifle before, and had never tried to learn to drill
or to shoot, and so they were hopelessly at sea at first.
It is not much fun to have to face an enemy who means
to kill you, when you have never learned to shoot.</p>

<p class='c005'>Every boy ought to learn how to shoot and to obey
orders, else he is no more good when war breaks out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>than an old woman, and merely gets killed like a
squealing rabbit, being unable to defend himself.</p>

<p class='c005'>Altogether, then, we only had about a thousand men
all told to defend the place which contained 600 white
women and children, and about 7,000 natives, and was
about five miles round.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/fig001.jpg' alt='Lord Edward Cecil and Boy Scouts in Mafeking.' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Lord Edward Cecil and Boy Scouts in Mafeking.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Every man was of value, and as their numbers gradually
got less, owing to men getting killed and wounded,
the duties of fighting and keeping watch at night got
harder for the rest. It was then that Lord Edward
Cecil, the chief staff officer, got together the boys in the
place and made them into a cadet corps, put them in
uniform and drilled them; and a jolly smart and useful
lot they were. We had till then used a large number of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>men for carrying orders and messages and keeping look-out,
and acting as orderlies and so on. These duties
were now handed over to the boy cadets, and the men
were released to go and strengthen the firing line.</p>

<p class='c005'>And the cadets, under their serjeant-major, a boy
named Goodyear, did right good work, and well deserved
the medals which they got at the end of the war. Many
of them rode bicycles, and we were thus able to establish
a post by which people could send letters to their
friends in the different forts, or about the town, without
going out under fire themselves; and we made postage
stamps for these letters which had on them a picture of
a cadet bicycle orderly.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Stamp.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>I said to one of these boys on one occasion, when he
came in through rather a heavy fire: "You will get hit one
of these days riding about like that when shells are flying."
And he replied: "I pedal so quick, sir, they'd never
catch me." These boys didn't seem to mind the bullets
one bit; they were always ready to carry out orders,
though it meant risk to their life every time.</p>

<p class='c005'>Would any of you do that? If an enemy were firing
down this street, and I were to tell one of you to take a
message across to a house on the other side, would you
do it? I am sure you would. But probably you wouldn't
much like doing it.</p>

<p class='c005'>But you want to prepare yourself for it beforehand.
It's just like taking a header into cold water; a fellow
who is accustomed to bathing thinks nothing of it; he
has practised it over and over again, but ask a fellow to
do it who has never practised it and he will funk it.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>So, too, with a boy who has been accustomed to obey
orders at once, whether there is risk about it or not;
the moment you order him to do a thing on active
service, no matter how great the danger is to him he
does it, while another chap who has never cared to obey
would object, and would then be despised as a coward
even by his former friends.</p>

<p class='c005'>But you need not wait for war in order to be useful as
a scout. As a peace scout there is lots for you to do
any day, wherever you may be.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>SCOUTS' WORK.</h4>
<p class='c004'>I suppose every British boy wants to help his country
in some way or other.</p>

<p class='c005'>There is a way, by which he can do so easily, and
that is by becoming a scout.</p>

<p class='c005'>A scout, as you know, is generally a soldier who is
chosen for his cleverness and pluck to go out in front of
an army in war to find out where the enemy are, and
report to the commander all about them.</p>

<p class='c005'>But, besides war scouts, there are also peace scouts, <i>i.e.</i>,
men who in peace time carry out work which requires
the same kind of abilities. These are the frontiersmen
of all parts of our Empire. The "trappers" of
North America, hunters of Central Africa, the British
pioneers, explorers, and missionaries over Asia and all
the wild parts of the world, the bushmen and drovers of
Australia, the constabulary of North-West Canada
and of South Africa&mdash;all are peace scouts, real <i>men</i>
in every sense of the word, and thoroughly up in
scout craft, <i>i.e.</i>, they understand living out in the
jungles, and they can find their way anywhere, are able
to read meaning from the smallest signs and foot-tracks;
they know how to look after their health when far away
from any doctors, are strong and plucky, and ready to
face any danger, and always keen to help each other.
They are accustomed to take their lives in their hands,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>and to fling them down without hesitation if they can
help their country by doing so.</p>

<p class='c005'>They give up everything, their personal comforts and
desires, in order to get their work done. They do not
do all this for their own amusement, but because it is
their duty to their King, fellow-countrymen, or employers.</p>

<p class='c005'>The History of the Empire has been made by British
adventurers and explorers, the scouts of the nation, for
hundreds of years past up to the present time.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Knights of King Arthur, Richard Coeur de Lion,
and the Crusaders, carried British chivalry into distant
parts of the earth.</p>

<p class='c005'>Raleigh, Drake, and Capt. John Smith, soldiers and
sailors of Queen Elizabeth's time, faced unknown
dangers of strange seas, as well as the known dangers
of powerful enemies, to take and hold new lands for
the expansion of our small kingdom.</p>

<p class='c005'>Capt. Cook in Australia, Lord Clive in India, opened
up new countries. Speke, Baker, and Livingstone pushed
their way through the savage deserts and forests of
Africa; Franklin and Ross braved the ice and snows of
the Arctic regions.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the present time Selous, the great hunter, and
Lieut. Boyd Alexander, who last year crossed Africa,
are peace scouts.</p>

<p class='c005'>These are just a few names out of many hundreds of
the scouts of the nation who have from all times down
to the present spread the good name and power of our
country in all parts of the world.</p>

<p class='c005'>And there have been women scouts of the nation, too:
such as Grace Darling, who risked her life to save a
shipwrecked crew; Florence Nightingale, who nursed
sick soldiers in the Crimean War; Miss Kingsley, the
African explorer; Lady Lugard, in Africa and Alaska;
and many devoted lady missionaries and nurses in all
parts of our Empire. These have shown that girls as
well as boys may well learn scouting while they are
young, and so be able to do useful work in the world
as they grow older.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>It is a grand life, but it cannot suddenly be taken up
by any man who thinks he would like it, unless he has
prepared himself for it beforehand.</p>

<p class='c005'>Those who succeed best are those who learnt scouting
while they were still boys.</p>

<p class='c005'>Scouting also comes in very useful in any kind of life
you like to take up, whether it is soldiering or even
business life in a city. Sir William Crookes says it is
even valuable for a man who goes in for science, and
finding out little things about air, and light, and so on.</p>

<p class='c005'>So I am going to show you how you can learn scout-craft
for yourself and can put it into practice at home.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is very easy to learn and very interesting when you
get into it. You can best learn by joining the "Boy
Scouts."</p>
<h4 class='c012'>"KIM."</h4>
<p class='c004'>A good example of what a Boy Scout can do is to be
found in Rudyard Kipling's story of "Kim."</p>

<p class='c005'>"Kim," or, to give him his full name, Kimball O'Hara,
was the son of a sergeant of an Irish regiment in India.
His father and mother died while he was a child, and he
had been left to the care of an aunt who lived in an
humble way in India.</p>

<p class='c005'>His playmates were all natives, so he got to talk their
language and to know their ways better than any European.
He became great friends with an old wandering
priest who was tramping about India, and with whom he
travelled all over the north part of that country. At last,
one day he chanced to meet his father's old regiment on
the line of march, and in visiting the camp he was
arrested on suspicion of being a thief. His birth certificate
and other papers were found on him, and the
regiment, seeing that he had belonged to them, took
charge of him, and started to educate him. But whenever
he could get away for holidays he dressed himself
in Indian clothes, and went again among the natives as
one of them.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>After a time he became acquainted with a Mr. Lurgan,
a dealer in old jewellery and curiosities, who, owing to
his knowledge from dealing with natives, was also a
member of the Government Intelligence Department.</p>

<p class='c005'>[<i>Explain this.</i>]</p>

<p class='c005'>This man, finding that Kim had such special knowledge
of native habits and customs, saw that he would
make a useful agent for Government Intelligence work,
that is, a kind of detective among the natives. But, first
of all, before employing him, he put him to one or two
tests to see whether he was sufficiently brave and strong-minded.</p>

<p class='c005'>As a trial of his strong-mindedness he attempted to
mesmerise him, that is to say, he tried to make Kim's
thoughts obey what was in his own mind. It is possible
for strong-minded men to do this with those of weaker
mind. The way he attempted it was by throwing down a
jug of water so that it smashed to pieces; he then laid
his fingers on the boy's neck, and wished him to imagine
the jug mended itself again. But, do what he would to
make his thought reach the boy's brain, he failed; Kim
saw the jug was broken, and would not believe it was
mended, although at one time he nearly obeyed him, for
he saw a kind of vision of the jug being mended, but it
faded away again.</p>

<p class='c005'>Most boys would have let their mind and eyes wander,
and would not have been able to keep them on the one
subject, and would so have easily become mesmerised by
the man.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lurgan, finding him strong-minded and quick at
learning, then gave him lessons at noticing small details
and remembering them, which is a most important point
in the training of a scout&mdash;it is a thing that he should learn
and be practising every hour of the day wherever he may
be. Lurgan began it with Kim by showing him a tray
full of precious stones of different kinds&mdash;he let him look
at it for a minute, and then covered it with a cloth, and
asked him to state how many stones and what sort were
there. At first he found he could only remember a few,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>and could not describe them very accurately, but with a
little practice he soon got to remember them all quite well.
And so, also, with many other kinds of articles which
were shown to him in the same way.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then Kim travelled about the country a great deal
with a fine old Afghan horse-dealer to whom he was
much attached, who was also an agent of the Intelligence
Department. On one occasion Kim was able to do him
a good turn by carrying an important message for him
secretly; and another time he saved his life by overhearing
some natives planning to murder him when he
came along. By pretending to be asleep and then
having a nightmare which caused him to move from his
position, Kim got away from the neighbourhood of the
would-be murderers, and was able to give warning to his
friend in good time.</p>

<p class='c005'>At last he was made a member of the Secret Service,
and was given a secret sign&mdash;namely, a badge to wear
round his neck and a certain sentence to say, which, if
said in a peculiar way, meant he was one of the service.
Scouts generally have secret signs by which they can
communicate with each other.</p>

<p class='c005'>The members of the Intelligence Service are very
numerous in India, and do not know each other by sight,
so they have to have a secret sign by which they will
recognise each other among other people who may be
their enemies.</p>

<p class='c005'>Once when travelling in the train Kim met another
member whom he did not know. This was a native,
who when he got into the carriage was evidently in a
great state of alarm, and was rather badly cut about the
head and arms. He explained to the other passengers
that he had met with an accident from a cart whilst he
was driving to the station, but Kim, like a good scout,
noticed the cuts were sharp and not grazes such as you
would get by falling from a cart, and so did not believe
him. While the man was tying up a bandage over his
head, Kim noticed he was wearing a locket like his own;
so Kim let his own be seen. Directly the man saw it he
brought into conversation some of the secret words, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Kim answered with the proper ones in reply. So then
the stranger got into a corner with Kim and explained
to him that he was carrying out some secret service
work, and had been found out and hunted by some of
the enemies of the Government who had nearly killed
him. They probably knew he was in the train and
would therefore telegraph down the line to their friends
that he was coming. He wanted to get his message to a
certain police officer without being caught by the enemy,
but he could not tell how to do it if they were already
warned of his coming. Kim thereupon hit upon the idea
of disguising him.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Kim disguising the native spy.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>In India there are a number of holy beggars who go
about the country. They wear next to no clothing and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>smear themselves with ashes, and paint certain marks on
their faces; they are considered very holy, and people
always help them with food and money. So Kim made
a mixture of flour and wood ashes, which he took from
the bowl of a native pipe, and he undressed his friend
and smeared these all over him, and finally, with the aid
of a little paint-box which he carried, he painted the
proper marks on the man's forehead. He smeared the
man's wounds with flour and ashes, partly so as to heal
them, and also so that they did not show; and he
brushed his hair down to look wild and shaggy like that of
a beggar, and covered it with dust so that the man's own
mother would not have known him. Soon afterwards
they got to a big station where on the platform they
found the police officer to whom the report was to be
made. The imitation beggar pushed up against him and
got abused by the officer in English; the beggar replied
with a string of native abuse into which he introduced
the secret words. The police officer, although he had
pretended not to know Hindustani, understood it quite
well, and at once recognised from the secret words that
this beggar was an agent; and so he pretended to arrest
him and marched him off to the police-station where he
could talk to him quietly. It was thus done without
anyone on the platform knowing that they were in league
with each other, or that this native beggar was the
escaped Intelligence agent.</p>

<p class='c005'>Finally, Kim became acquainted with another agent of
the department&mdash;an educated native or Babu as they are
called in India&mdash;and was able to give him great assistance
in capturing two Russian officers who were acting
as spies against the British on the north-west frontier of
India.</p>

<p class='c009'>[<i>Note.&mdash;Point out on map respective positions of
British and Russians.</i>]</p>

<p class='c007'>The Babu pretended to the Russians that he was the
manager for a local native prince who did not like the
English, and travelled with them for some time as representative
of this prince. In this way he got to know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>where they kept their secret papers in their baggage.
At last he got up trouble between them and a holy priest,
whom they struck; this caused great excitement among
the natives, who rushed off with the baggage and got
lost in the darkness. Kim, who was among the natives,
opened the luggage and found the secret papers which
he took out and carried to headquarters.</p>

<p class='c005'>These and other adventures of Kim are well worth
reading, because they show what valuable work a boy
scout could do for his country if he were sufficiently
trained and sufficiently intelligent.</p>

  <h4 class='c012'>CAMP FIRE YARN.&mdash;No. 2. <br /> SUMMARY OF SCOUT'S COURSE OF INSTRUCTION.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c004'>To become a Boy Scout you join a patrol belonging to
your Cadet Corps, or Boys' Brigade or club.</p>

<p class='c005'>If you are not a member of one of these, or if it does
not as yet possess a patrol of scouts, you can raise
a patrol yourself by getting five other boys to join.
They should, if possible, be all about the same age.
One boy is then chosen as Patrol Leader to command
the patrol, and he selects another boy to be the Corporal
or second in command. Several patrols together can form
a "Troop" under an officer called a "Scoutmaster."</p>

<p class='c005'>You all take the scout's oath, that is you promise, <i>on
your honour</i>, three things, namely:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1.  To be loyal to God and the King.</div>
      <div class='line'>2.  To help other people at all times.</div>
      <div class='line'>3.  To obey the scout law.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>You learn the scout sign of the scouts (see page <a href='#Page_40'>40</a>),
and also the call of your patrol (see page <a href='#Page_45'>45</a>).</p>

<p class='c005'>Every patrol is named after some animal, and each
scout in it has to be able to make the cry of that animal
in order to communicate with his pals, especially at
night. Thus you may be "the Wolves," "the Curlews,"
"the Eagles," or "the Rats" if you like. No scout may
ever use the call of another patrol. The second law binds
you to be loyal, kind, obedient, and cheerful. Most of your
work then consists in playing scouting games and practices
by which you gain experience as scouts. When you
have learned sufficient to pass the test you can win the
badge of either a first class or second class scout.</p>

<p class='c005'>That of the first class scout consists of a brass arrow
head with the motto on it "<span class='sc'>Be Prepared</span>."</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>That of the second class scout is merely the motto
without the arrow head.</p>

<p class='c005'>The meaning of the motto is that a scout must prepare
himself by previous thinking out and practising how to
act on any accident or emergency so that he is never
taken by surprise; he knows exactly what to do when
anything unexpected happens.</p>

<p class='c005'>The following subjects are what you have to know
about to pass the test as a scout:&mdash;</p>
<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Woodcraft</span> means knowing all about animals, which
is gained by following up their foot-tracks and creeping
up to them so that you can watch them in their natural
state, and learn the different kinds of animals and their
various habits. You only shoot them if in want of food;
but no scout wilfully kills an animal for the mere sake
of killing, unless it is a harmful creature.</p>

<p class='c005'>A good story is told of a soldier in the South African
War who killed a harmless animal, namely a sheep,
when the order had been given out that nobody was to
kill any animal except a "savage wild beast."</p>

<p class='c005'>But the soldier wanted some mutton, and he found a
sheep round at the back of a house; so he started to
make it into mutton with his bayonet. Just as he was
doing so an officer happened to come round the corner.
The soldier saw the danger that he was in for disobeying
the order, but he did not lose his head. Pretending
not to see the officer, he again plunged his
bayonet into the wretched sheep, shouting at the same
time, "Ah, you would bite me, would you? You 'savage
wild beast'!"</p>

<p class='c005'>By continually watching animals in their natural state
one gets to like them too well to shoot them.</p>

<p class='c005'>The whole sport of hunting animals lies in the woodcraft
of stalking them, not in the killing.</p>

<p class='c005'>Woodcraft includes, besides being able to see the
tracks and other small signs, the power to read their
meaning, such as at what pace the animal was going,
whether he was frightened or unsuspicious, and so on.
It enables the hunter also to find his way in the jungle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>or desert; it teaches him which are the best wild fruits,
roots, etc., for his own food, or which are favourite food
for animals, and, therefore, likely to attract them.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the same way in scouting in civilised countries you
read the tracks of men, horses, bicycles, etc., and find
out from these what has been going on; noticing by
small signs, such as birds suddenly starting up, that
someone is moving near, though you cannot see them.</p>

<p class='c005'>By noticing little things on the ground you will often
find lost articles, which you can then restore to their
owners.</p>

<p class='c005'>By noticing details of harness, and so on, you can
often save a horse from the pain of an ill-fitting strap
or bit.</p>

<p class='c005'>By noticing the behaviour or dress of people, and
putting this and that together, you can sometimes see
that they are up to no good, and can thus prevent a crime,
or you can often tell when they are in distress and need
help or sympathy&mdash;and you can then do what is one
of the chief duties of a scout, namely, help those in
distress in any possible way that you can.</p>

<p class='c005'>Remember that it is a disgrace to a scout if, when he
is with other people, they see anything big or little, near
or far, high or low, that he has not already seen for
himself.</p>

<p class='c005'>Kim, when learning to be scout, was taught to notice
small things quickly and to remember them, by being
shown a tray full of small articles for a few moments
and then having to state what he had seen.</p>

<p class='c005'>[<i>Play Kim's game. See page <a href='#Page_54'>54</a>.</i>]</p>
<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Campaigning.</span>&mdash;Scouts must, of course, be accustomed
to living in the open; they have to know how to put up
tents or huts for themselves; how to lay and light a fire;
how to kill, cut up, and cook their food; how to tie logs
together to make bridges and rafts; how to find their
way by night, as well as by day, in a strange country,
and so on.</p>

<p class='c005'>But very few fellows learn or practise these things
when they are living in civilised places because they get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>comfortable houses and beds to sleep in, their food is
prepared and cooked for them, and when they want to
know the way "they ask a policeman."</p>

<p class='c005'>Well, when those fellows go out to a colony, or try to
go scouting, they find themselves helpless duffers.</p>

<p class='c005'>Take even the captain of your cricket eleven and put
him down on the South African veldt alongside the
young Colonial, and see which can look after himself.
High averages and clean flannels are not much good to
him there. He is only a "tenderfoot," and would be the
object of continual chaff until he got some scoutcraft
into him.</p>

<p class='c005'>And scoutcraft, mind you, comes in useful in any line
of life that you like to take up. Cricket doesn't matter
a hang&mdash;though it is a jolly good game to play, and
comes in useful to a certain extent in training a fellow's
eye, nerve, and temper. But, as the American would
say, "it isn't a circumstance" to scouting which teaches
a fellow to be a man.</p>

<p class='c009'>[<i>Make each boy lay a fire in his own way and light
it. After failures, show them the right way
(i.e., delicate use of dry chips and shavings, and
sticks in a pyramid), and make them do it again.
Also teach them how to tie knots.</i> <i>See <a href='#part3'>Part III</a>.</i>]</p>
<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chivalry.</span>&mdash;In the old days the knights were the
scouts of Britain, and their rules were very much the
same as the scout law which we have now. And very
much like what the Japs have, too. We are their
descendants, and we ought to keep up their good name
and follow in their steps.</p>

<p class='c005'>They considered that their honour was the most sacred
thing to uphold; they would not do a dishonourable thing,
such as telling a lie or stealing: they would really rather
die than do it. They were always ready to fight and to
be killed in upholding their king, or their religion, or
their honour. Thousands of them went out to Palestine
(the Holy Land) to maintain the Christian religion against
the Mahommedan Turks.</p>

<p class='c005'>Each knight had a small following of a squire and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>some men-at-arms, just as our patrol leader has his
corporal and four or five scouts.</p>

<p class='c005'>The knight's patrol used to stick to him through thick
and thin, and all carried out the same idea as their leader&mdash;namely:</p>

<p class='c009'>Their honour was sacred.</p>

<p class='c010'>They were loyal to God, and their king, and to their
country.</p>

<p class='c010'>They were particularly courteous and polite to all
women and children and infirm people.</p>

<p class='c010'>They were helpful to everybody.</p>

<p class='c010'>They gave money and food where it was wanted and
saved up their money in order to do so.</p>

<p class='c010'>They taught themselves the use of arms in order to
protect their religion and their country against
enemies.</p>

<p class='c010'>They kept themselves strong and healthy and active
in order to be able to do these things well.</p>

<p class='c007'>You scouts cannot do better than follow the example
of your forefathers, the knights, who made the tiny
British nation into one of the best and greatest that the
world has ever known.</p>

<p class='c005'>One great point about them was that every day they
had to do a good turn to somebody, and that is one of
our rules. When you get up in the morning remember
that you have got to do a good turn to someone during
the day; tie a knot in your handkerchief or necktie, and
leave the tail of your necktie outside your waistcoat to
remind yourself of it; and when you go to bed at night
think who you did the good turn to.</p>

<p class='c005'>If you should ever find that you had forgotten to do
it, you must do two good turns the next day instead.
Remember that by your scout's oath you are on your
honour to do it.</p>

<p class='c005'>A good turn need only be a very small one; if it is
only to put a halfpenny into a poor box, or to help an
old woman to cross the street, or to make room on a seat
for someone, or to give water to a thirsty horse, or to
remove a bit of banana skin off the pavement where it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>likely to throw people down, it is a good turn. But one
must be done every day, and it only counts as a good
when you do not accept any reward in return.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Saving Life.</span>&mdash;You have all heard of the Victoria
Cross&mdash;the little bronze cross given by Queen Victoria to
soldiers who specially distinguish themselves in action
under the fire of the enemy.</p>

<p class='c005'>But there is the companion medal to it, and that is the
Albert Medal for those who are not soldiers, and who
distinguish themselves in saving life in peace time.</p>

<p class='c005'>And I think the man who wins this medal, as he does
in the sudden appalling accidents which occur in big
cities, mines, and factories, in everyday life, is no less a
hero than the soldier who rushes into the thick of the
fight to rescue a comrade amid all the excitement and
glamour of the battle.</p>

<p class='c005'>My great hope is that many of you scouts will in time
to come win for yourselves the high honour of receiving
the Albert Medal.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is certain that very many of you will at one time or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>another get the chance of it if you are prepared to seize
the opportunity. That is, you must be <i>prepared</i> for it;
you should know what to do the moment an accident
occurs&mdash;and do it then and there.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is not enough to read about it in a book and think that
you know how to do it&mdash;but you must actually practise,
and practise pretty often, the actual things to be done;
such as how to cover your mouth and nose with a wet
handkerchief to enable you to breath in smoke, how to
tear a sheet into strips and make a rope for escaping
from fire, how to open a manhole to let air into a gassy
sewer, how to lift and carry an insensible person, how to
collar, save, and revive apparently drowned people, and
so on.</p>

<p class='c005'>When you have learnt all these things you will have
confidence in yourself, so that when an accident happens
and everybody is in a state of fluster, not knowing what
to do, you will quietly step out and do the right thing.</p>

<p class='c005'>Remember the case at the Hampstead Ponds last year
when a woman drowned herself in shallow water before
a whole lot of men, who were too frightened to do anything
but shout to her. It was a disgrace to our nation
that there was not a real man amongst them. It would
have been a grand opportunity for a Boy Scout, had
there been one there, to go in and fetch her out. As it
was, these cowards stood there clamouring and chattering
on the bank&mdash;not one of them daring to go in because
the others did not. And she was drowned before their
eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>[<i>Teach the scouts how to lift and carry an insensible
man. Also how to drag an insensible
man through smoke, gas, etc. Also how to cover
nose and mouth with wet handkerchief. Divide
them off into pairs, and let each in turn act as
insensible patient to be rescued by his comrade.</i>]</p>
<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Endurance.</span>&mdash;To carry out all the duties and work of
a scout properly a fellow has to be strong, healthy, and
active. And he can make himself so if he takes a little
care about it.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>It means a lot of exercise, like playing games, running,
walking, cycling, and so on.</p>

<p class='c005'>A scout has to sleep very much in the open, and a boy
who is accustomed to sleep with his window shut will
probably suffer, like many a tenderfoot has done, by
catching cold and rheumatism when he first tries sleeping
out. The thing is always to sleep with your windows
open, summer and winter, and you will never catch cold.
Personally I cannot sleep with my window shut or with
blinds down, and when living in the country I always
sleep outside the house, summer and winter alike. A
soft bed and too many blankets make a boy dream bad
dreams, which weaken him.</p>

<p class='c005'>A short go of Swedish or ju-jitsu exercises every
morning and evening is a grand thing for keeping you
fit&mdash;not so much for making showy muscle as to work
all your internal organs [<i>Explain</i>], and to work up the
circulation of the blood in every part of you.</p>

<p class='c005'>A good rub down daily with a wet rough towel,
even if you cannot get a bath, which of course is
preferable, is of the utmost importance.</p>

<p class='c005'>Scouts breathe through the nose, not through the
mouth; in this way they don't get thirsty; they don't
get out of breath so quickly; they don't suck into their
insides all sorts of microbes or seeds of disease that are
in the air; and they don't snore at night, and so give
themselves away to an enemy.</p>

<p class='c005'>"Deep breathing" exercises are of great value for
developing the lungs, and for putting fresh air (oxygen)
into the blood, provided that they are carried out in
the open air, and are not overdone so as to injure the
heart, etc. For deep breathing the breath must be taken
in slowly and deeply through the nose, not through the
mouth, till it opens out the ribs to the greatest extent,
especially at the back; then, after a time it should be
slowly and steadily, breathed out again without strain.
But the best deep breathing after all is that which comes
naturally from plenty of running exercise.</p>

<p class='c005'>Alcohol is now shown to be quite useless as a health-giving
drink, and it is mere poison when a man takes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>much of it. A man who is in the habit of drinking wine
or spirits in strong doses every day is not the slightest
use for scouting, and very little use for anything else.</p>

<p class='c005'>Similarly a man who smokes much. The best war
scouts don't smoke because it weakens their eyesight;
it sometimes makes them shaky and nervous;
it spoils their noses for smelling (which is of great
importance at night), and the glow of their pipe, or
even the scent of tobacco carried on them at night gives
them away to watchful enemies. They are not such
fools as to smoke. No boy ever began smoking because
he liked it, but because he thought it made him look like
a grown-up man. As a matter of fact it generally makes
him look a little ass.</p>

<p class='c009'>[<i>Show ju-jitsu or Swedish extension motions&mdash;one
or two exercises only to begin with. Also
deep breathing.</i>]</p>
<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Patriotism.</span>&mdash;You belong to the Great British Empire,
one of the greatest empires that has ever existed in the
world.</p>

<p class='c005'>[<i>Show on the map.</i>]</p>

<p class='c005'>From this little island of Great Britain have sprung
colonies all over the world, Australia, New Zealand,
South Africa, India, Canada.</p>

<p class='c005'>Almost every race, every kind of man, black, white, or
yellow, in the world furnishes subjects of King
Edward VII.</p>

<p class='c005'>This vast empire did not grow of itself out of nothing;
it was made by your forefathers by dint of hard work
and hard fighting, at the sacrifice of their lives&mdash;that is,
by their hearty patriotism.</p>

<p class='c005'>People say that we have no patriotism nowadays, and
that therefore our empire will fall to pieces like the
great Roman empire did, because its citizens became
selfish and lazy, and only cared for amusements. I am
not so sure about that. I am sure that if you boys will
keep the good of your country in your eyes <i>above everything
else</i> she will go on all right. But if you don't do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>there is very great danger, because we have many
enemies abroad, and they are growing daily stronger and
stronger.</p>

<p class='c005'>Therefore, in all that you do, remember to think of your
country first; don't spend the whole of your time and
money on games and tuck shops merely to amuse <i>yourself</i>,
but think first how you can be of use in helping your
empire, and when you have done that you can justly and
honestly sit down and enjoy yourself in your own way.</p>

<p class='c005'>"Country first, self second," should be your motto.
Probably, if you ask yourself truly, you will find you
have at present got them just the other way about.</p>

<p class='c005'>I hope if it is so that you will from this moment put
yourself right and remain so always, Patriot first,
player second. Don't be content, like the Romans
were, and some people now are, to pay other people to
play your football or to fight your battles for you. Do
something yourself to help in keeping the flag flying.</p>

<p class='c005'>If you take up scouting in that spirit you will be
doing something; take it up, not merely because it
amuses you, but because by doing so you will be fitting
yourself to help your country. Then you will have in
you the true spirit of patriotism, which every British
boy ought to have if he is worth his salt.</p>

<h4 class='c012'>WINTER'S STOB; OR, THE ELSDON MURDER.</h4>
<p class='c006'>[<i>Note: The following story, which in the main is
true, is a sample of a story that should be
given by the Instructor illustrating generally
the duties of a Boy Scout.</i>]</p>

<p class='c007'>A brutal murder took place many years ago in the
North of England; and the murderer was caught, convicted,
and hanged chiefly through the scoutcraft of a
shepherd boy.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span><span class='sc'>Woodcraft.</span>&mdash;The boy, Robert Hindmarsh, had
been up on the moor tending his sheep, and was finding
his way home over a wild, out-of-the-way part of the
hills, when he passed a tramp sitting on the ground with
his legs stretched out in front of him eating some food.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Observation.</span>&mdash;The boy in passing noticed his
appearance, and especially the peculiar nails in the soles
of his boots.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Concealment.</span>&mdash;He did not stop and stare, but just
took these things in at a glance as he went by without
attracting much attention from the man, who merely
regarded him as an ordinary boy not worth his notice.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id007'>
<img src='images/fig007.jpg' alt='Observing the murderer&#39;s boots.' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Observing the murderer's boots.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Deduction.</span>&mdash;When he got near home, some five or
six miles away, he came to a crowd round a cottage,
where they had found the old woman (Margaret Crozier)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>who inhabited it lying murdered. All sorts of guesses
were being hazarded as to who had done the deed, and
suspicion seemed to centre on a small gang of three or
four gipsies who were going about the country robbing
and threatening death to anyone who made any report of
their misdeeds.</p>

<p class='c005'>The boy heard all these things, but presently he saw
some peculiar footprints in the little garden of the
cottage; the nailmarks agreed with those he had seen in
the boots of the man on the moor, and he naturally
deduced from these that the man might have something
to do with the murder.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Chivalry.</span>&mdash;The fact that it was a helpless old woman
who had been murdered made the boy's chivalrous
feelings rise against the murderer, whoever it might be.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Pluck and Self-discipline, Alacrity.</span>&mdash;So,
although he knew that the friends of the murderer might
kill him for giving information, he cast his fears on one
side and went at once and told the constable of the footmarks
in the garden, and where he could find the man
who had made them&mdash;if he went immediately.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Health and Strength.</span>&mdash;The man up on the moor
had got so far from the scene of the murder, unseen
(except by this one small boy), that he thought himself
safe, and never thought of the boy being able to walk
all the way to the scene of the murder and then to
come back, as he did, with the police. So he took no
precautions.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the boy was a strong, healthy hill-boy, and did
the journey rapidly and well, so that they found the man
and captured him without difficulty.</p>

<p class='c005'>The man was Willie Winter, a gipsy.</p>

<p class='c005'>He was tried, found guilty, and hanged at Newcastle.
His body was then brought and hung on a gibbet near
the scene of the murder, as was the custom in those
days, and the gibbet still stands to this day. Two of
the gipsies who were his accomplices were caught with
some of the stolen property, and were also executed at
Newcastle.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span><span class='sc'>Kind-heartedness.</span>&mdash;But when the boy saw the
murderer's body hanging there on the gibbet he was
overcome with misery at having caused the death of a
fellow-creature.</p>

and complimented him on the great good he had done to
his fellow-countrymen&mdash;probably saving some of their
lives&mdash;by ridding the world of such a dangerous
criminal.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Duty.</span>&mdash;He said: "You have done your duty although
it caused you personally some danger and much distress.
Still you must not mind that&mdash;it was your duty to the

duty must always be carried out regardless of how much
it costs you, even if you had to give up your life."</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Example.</span>&mdash;Thus the boy did every part of the duty of
a boy scout without ever having been taught.</p>

duty. In the same way you should remember your acts
may be watched by others after you, and taken as an
example too. So try to do your duty the right way on
all occasions.</p>
<p class='c004'>Since writing down the above story I have visited the
place, Stang's Cross, where the gibbet, with a wooden
head hanging from it, still stands as a warning to evildoers.
Some foolish people used to believe that toothache
could be cured by rubbing the teeth with chips of
wood cut from this gibbet, and used to come from miles
round to get them. Mrs. Haldane, the mother of our
present Secretary of State for War, remembers seeing
the effigy of Winter hanging on the gibbet, and recalls
with horror the doleful rattling of the chains on which it
swung in the night wind on the lonely moor. The
gibbet is known as "Winter's Stob."</p>

<p class='c005'>Winter belonged to a notable family. He was not
the only one who distinguished himself, for his father
and his brother were also hanged for different offences.
Another brother, feeling the disgrace of belonging to
such a family, changed his name from Winter to Spring,
and became&mdash;a prize-fighter.</p>

</div>
<p class='c004'>It is not intended that boy scouts should necessarily
form a new corps separate from all others, but the boys
who belong to any kind of existing organisation, such as
schools, football clubs, Boys' or Church Lads' Brigades,
factories, district messengers, Telegraph Service, Cadet
Corps, etc., etc., can <i>also</i> take up scouting in addition to
their other work or play&mdash;especially on Saturdays and
Sundays.</p>

<p class='c005'>But where there are any boys who do not belong to
any kind of organisation&mdash;and there is a very large
number of such boys about the United Kingdom&mdash;they
can form themselves into Patrols and become Boy
Scouts.</p>

<p class='c005'>For this purpose officers are necessary.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Officers</i>: The head officer of all the boy scouts in
the world is called the <i>Chief Scout</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>A Scout Master</i> is an officer who has charge of a
troop. A troop consists of not less than three
patrols. Scouts address the scout master as
"Sir."</p>

<p class='c010'><i>A Patrol Leader</i> is a scout appointed to command a
patrol. A patrol consists of six scouts. Any
lad or young man who learns scouting from this
book can make himself a patrol leader and collect
and train five or seven boys to be scouts.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>A Corporal</i> is a scout selected by the patrol leader
to be his assistant, and to take command of the
patrol when he himself is away.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span><i>A Scout</i> is of two kinds&mdash;first-class and second-class.</p>

<p class='c010'>First-class scout is one who has passed certain
tests to show that he is able to scout.</p>

<p class='c010'>Second-class scout is one who has passed certain
easy tests in scouting.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>A Tenderfoot</i> is a boy who is not yet a scout.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>A Court of Honour</i> is formed of the scout master
and two patrol leaders, or in the case of a single
patrol by the patrol leader and the corporal.
It decides rewards, punishments, and other
questions.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Tests</i>: To become a second-class scout and gain the
motto badge, a boy must satisfy his scout master in the
following details:</p>

<p class='c009'>1. Tie four of the following knots in less than
thirty seconds each knot: Bowline, fisherman's
bend, reef knot, clove hitch, sheet bend.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. Track a deer's "spoor" (made with tracking
irons) or a horse's track for a quarter of a mile
in not more than fifteen minutes; or, in a town,
to describe satisfactorily the contents of one shop
window out of four observed for one minute
each.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. Go at scout's pace for one mile in not more than
thirteen minutes.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. Know the scout's laws and signs.</p>

<p class='c010'>5. Know the composition of the Union Jack, and
the right way to fly it.</p>

<p class='c007'>To become a first-class scout and gain the whole
scout's badge, a boy must pass the following test&mdash;in
addition to those for second-class scout (above)&mdash;before
a Court of Honour. (<i>N.B.</i>&mdash;In the case of a new troop
the Scout Master can act as the Court of Honour.)</p>

<p class='c009'>6. Point out the direction of different points of the
compass where he stands.</p>

<p class='c010'>7. Make a journey alone of not less than fifteen
miles from point to point by walking, riding, boat,
or bicycle.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>8.  Describe or show the proper means for saving
life in case of one (selected by the Court) of the
following accidents: fire, drowning, runaway
carriage, sewer gas, ice-breaking; or bandage an
injured patient, or revive apparently drowned
persons.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.  Be able to read and write.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.  Have at least sixpence in the savings bank.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.  Show that he has brought a recruit to the Boy
Scouts, and has taught him to tie the six principal
knots.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.  To lay and light a fire, using not more than
two matches, and cook a quarter of a pound of
flour and two potatoes without cooking utensils.</p>

always be prepared at any moment to do his duty, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>to face danger in order to help his fellow-men. Its
scroll is turned up at the ends like a scout's mouth, because
he does his duty with a smile and willingly.</p>

<p class='c005'>The knot is to remind the scout to do a good turn to
some one daily.</p>

<p class='c005'>A scout's badge represents and is called his "life."
It is given him when he passes the tests in scout-craft
necessary to make him a scout.</p>

<p class='c005'>He will be called on at some time or the other to risk
his life, that is to perform some difficult task, and if he
fails in it he loses his life&mdash;that is his badge. In such
case a Court of Honour may allow him to remain in the
patrol, but he cannot have his badge again, unless he
performs some very specially good work.</p>

<p class='c005'>If he breaks his word of honour, or otherwise disgraces
himself, his life is taken (that is his badge), and he is
expelled from the patrol.</p>

<p class='c010'>First Aid: for passing the St. John Ambulance tests
in First Aid.</p>

<p class='c010'>Stalking: series of twelve photos of wild animals
taken from life by the scout and developed and

<p class='c010'>Merit: for twenty good marks for various good deeds.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span><i>Medals</i> are worn on the right breast, and are as follows:</p>

<p class='c009'>Bronze medal with red ribbon: For gallantry in
saving life, or attempting to save life at risk of
own life.</p>

<p class='c010'>Silver medal with red ribbon: For saving and
helping to save life without risk of own life, but
where life might have been lost.</p>

<p class='c010'>Silver medal with blue ribbon: Meritorious service,
or assisting police at personal risk.</p>

<p class='c007'>These are only granted by the chief scout on special
recommendation from the patrol leader or scout master,
who should send in a full account of the case when
applying.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>Marks</i> are awarded by scout masters, from their
own knowledge or on recommendation of patrol leaders,
or as marks for competition.</p>

<p class='c005'>Two marks are given to any scout who brings a
recruit whom he has already taught to tie the regulation
knots. Such recruit must be in addition to the one who
enabled him to qualify for his scout's badge.</p>

<p class='c005'>"<i>The Wolf.</i>"&mdash;The Red Indians of North America
call their best scout "Grey Wolf," because the grey wolf
is a beast that sees everything and yet is never seen.</p>

<p class='c005'>And the fighting tribes in South Africa in the same
way speak of a scout as a wolf.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the Matabele War, 1896-1897, the enemy called
me "The Wolf" for that reason.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Thompson Seton, the head of the "Red Indian"
Boy Scouts in America, is called "Grey Wolf."</p>

<p class='c005'>So in the Boy Scouts a special badge and title of
"Wolf" will be given as a reward for very special distinction
in scouting; not more than one will be granted
in a year.</p>

<p class='c005'>All medals and badges are only worn as above when
scouts are on duty or in camp. At other times they
should be worn on the right breast of the waistcoat,
underneath the jacket.</p>

<p class='c005'>A small arrow-head badge may be worn at all times in
the button-hole.</p>

  <h4 class='c012'>THE SCOUT'S OATH.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c004'>Before he becomes a scout a boy must take the scout's
oath, thus:</p>

<p class='c005'>"On my honour I promise that&mdash;</p>

<p class='c009'>1. I will do my duty to God and the King.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. I will do my best to help others, whatever it
costs me.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. I know the scout law, and will obey it."</p>

<p class='c010'>(For Scout Law, see page <a href='#Page_40'>40</a>.)</p>

<p class='c007'>While taking this oath the scout will stand, holding his
right hand raised level with his shoulder, palm to the front,
thumb resting on the nail of the little finger, and the
other three fingers upright, pointing upwards:&mdash;</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Scout's Salute and Secret Sign.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>This is the scout's salute and secret sign.</p>

<p class='c005'>When the hand is raised shoulder high it is called the
"Half Salute."</p>

<p class='c005'>When raised to the forehead it is the "Full Salute."</p>
<h4 class='c012'>SCOUT'S SALUTE AND SECRET SIGN.</h4>
<p class='c004'>The three fingers held up (like the three points of
the scout's badge) remind him of his three promises in the
scout's oath.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>2. Help others.</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>When a scout meets another for the first time in the
day, whether he is a comrade or a stranger, he salutes
with the secret sign in the half salute.</p>

<p class='c005'>He always salutes an officer&mdash;that is, a patrol leader,
or a scout master, or any officer of His Majesty's forces,
army, navy, or police in uniform&mdash;with the full salute.</p>

<p class='c005'>Also the hoisting of the Union Jack, the colours of a
regiment, the playing of "God Save the King," and
any funeral.</p>

<p class='c005'>A scout who has the "Wolf" honour is entitled to
make the sign with the first finger and thumb opened
out, the remaining fingers clenched, thumb upwards.</p>

<p class='c005'>A man told me the other day that "he was an Englishman,
and just as good as anybody else, and he was
blowed if ever he would raise a finger to salute his so-called
'betters': he wasn't going to be a slave and kow-tow
to them, not he!" and so on. That is a churlish
spirit, which is very common among fellows who have
not been brought up as scouts.</p>

<p class='c005'>I didn't argue with him, but I might have told him that
he had got hold of the wrong idea about saluting.</p>

<p class='c005'>A salute is merely a sign between men of standing.
It is a privilege to be able to salute anyone.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the old days the free men of England all were
allowed to carry weapons, and when they met each other
each would hold up his right hand to show that he had
no weapon in it, and that they met as friends. So also
when an armed man met a defenceless person or a lady.</p>

<p class='c005'>Slaves or serfs were not allowed to carry weapons,
and so had to slink past the freemen without making
any sign.</p>

<p class='c005'>Nowadays people do not carry weapons; but those
who would have been entitled to do so, such as
knights, esquires, and men-at-arms, that is anyone
living on their own property or earning their own living,
still go through the form of saluting each other by
holding up their hand to their cap, or even taking it off.</p>

<p class='c005'>"Wasters" are not entitled to salute, and so should
slink by, as they generally do, without taking notice of
the free men or wage-earners.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>To salute merely shows that you are a right sort of
fellow and mean well to the other; there is nothing
slavish about it.</p>

<p class='c005'>If a stranger makes the scout's sign to you, you should
acknowledge it at once by making the sign back to him,
and then shake hands with the LEFT HAND. If he then
shows his scout's badge, or proves that he is a scout,
you must treat him as a brother-scout, and help him in
any way you can.</p>

<p>SCOUT'S UNIFORM. Patrol Leader with Scout.</p>

<p class='c004'>If you already belong to a corps which has a uniform,
you dress in that uniform; but on passing the tests for a
scout given here you wear the scout badge, if your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>commanding officer allows it, in addition to any of your
corps' badges that you may have won.</p>

<p class='c005'>A scout does not use a showy uniform, because it
would attract attention; but scouts in a patrol should, as
far as possible, dress alike, especially as regards hats,
or caps, and neckerchief.</p>

<p class='c005'>If your patrol does not belong to any uniformed corps,
it should dress as nearly as possible thus:</p>

<p class='c009'>Flat brimmed hat if possible, or wide-awake hat.</p>

<p class='c010'>Coloured handkerchief tied loosely round neck.</p>

<p class='c010'>Shirt: Flannel.</p>

<p class='c010'>Haversack: To carry food, etc., slung on back across the shoulders.</p>

<p class='c010'>Shorts: Trousers cut short at knee. A kilt if you are a Scotsman.</p>

<p class='c010'>Stockings, with garters made of green braid, with
one end hanging down one inch.</p>

<p class='c010'>Boots or shoes.</p>

<p class='c010'>Staff as high as scout's shoulder. Not shod, as it
is for feeling the way at night quietly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Badge on left arm above elbow.</p>

<p class='c010'>Whistle, with cord round neck for patrol leader.</p>

<p class='c007'>N.B.&mdash;The colour of the neckerchief, or necktie and

<p class='c005'>Each scout in a patrol has his regular number, the
patrol leader being No. 1, the corporal No. 2, and the
scouts have the consecutive numbers after these. Scouts

Nos. 5 and 6 together, and Nos. 7 and 8.</p>

call of his patrol-animal&mdash;thus every scout in the
"Ravens" must be able to imitate the croak of the
raven. This is the sign by which scouts of a patrol can
communicate with each other when hiding or at night.
No scout is allowed to imitate the call of any patrol
except his own. The patrol leader calls up the patrol
at any time by sounding his whistle and uttering the
call of the patrol.</p>

<p class='c005'>Also when a scout makes signs on the ground for
others to read he also draws the head of the patrol
animal. Thus if he wants to show that a certain
road should not be followed he draws the sign across it
"Not to be followed," and adds the head of his patrol
animal to show which patrol discovered that the road
was no good, and his own number to the left of the
head to show which scout discovered it, thus:</p>

black and white.</p>

<p class='c005'>They come down to us from old times.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Japanese have their Bushido, or laws of the old
Samurai warriors, just as we have chivalry or rules of the
knights of the Middle Ages. The Red Indians in America

India, the European nations&mdash;all have their ancient
codes.</p>

<p class='c005'>The following are the rules which apply to Boy Scouts,

</div>
<p class='c004'>1.  <span class='sc'>A Scout's Honour is to be Trusted.</span></p>
<p class='c009'>If a scout says "On my honour it is so," that
means that it <i>is</i> so, just as if he had taken a
most solemn oath.</p>

<p class='c010'>Similarly, if a scout officer says to a scout, "I
trust you on your honour to do this," the scout
is bound to carry out the order to the very best of
his ability, and to let nothing interfere with his
doing so.</p>

<p class='c010'>If a scout were to break his honour by telling a
lie, or by not carrying out an order exactly
when trusted on his honour to do so, he would
cease to be a scout, and must hand over his
scout badge, and never be allowed to wear it
again&mdash;he loses his life.</p>
<p class='c007'>2.  <span class='sc'>A Scout is Loyal</span> to the King, and to his officers,
and to his country, and to his employers. He
must stick to them through thick and thin

talks badly of them.</p>

<p class='c005'>3.  <span class='sc'>A Scout's Duty is to be Useful and to
Help Others.</span></p>
<p class='c009'>And he is to do his duty before anything else,
even though he gives up his own pleasure, or
comfort, or safety to do it. When in difficulty
to know which of two things to do, he must ask
himself, "Which is my duty?" that is, "Which
is best for other people?"&mdash;and do that one.
He must Be Prepared at any time to save life,
or to help injured persons. And <i>he must do a
good turn</i> to somebody every day.</p>
<p class='c007'>4. <span class='sc'>A Scout is a Friend to All, and a Brother
to Every Other Scout, no matter
to what Social Class the Other
belongs.</span></p>
<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>Thus if a scout meets another scout, even though
a stranger to him, he must speak to him, and
help him in any way that he can, either to
carry out the duty he is then doing, or by
giving him food, or, as far as possible, anything
that he may be in want of. A scout must never
be a <span class='fss'>SNOB</span>. A snob is one who looks down
upon another because he is poorer, or who is
poor and resents another because he is rich. A
scout accepts the other man as he finds him,
and makes the best of him.</p>

<p class='c010'>"Kim," the boy scout, was called by the Indians
"Little friend of all the world," and that is the
name that every scout should earn for himself.</p>
<p class='c007'>5. <span class='sc'>A Scout is Courteous</span>: That is, he is polite
to all&mdash;but especially to women and children
and old people and invalids, cripples, etc.
And he must not take any reward for being
helpful or courteous.</p>

<p class='c005'>6. <span class='sc'>A Scout is a Friend to Animals</span>. He should
save them as far as possible from pain, and
should not kill any animal unnecessarily, even
if it is only a fly&mdash;for it is one of God's
creatures.</p>

<p class='c005'>7. <span class='sc'>A Scout Obeys Orders</span> of his patrol leader or
scout master without question.</p>
<p class='c009'>Even if he gets an order he does not like he must
do as soldiers and sailors do, he must carry it
out all the same <i>because it is his duty</i>; and
after he has done it he can come and state any
reasons against it: but he must must carry out
the order at once. That is discipline.</p>
<p class='c007'>8.  <span class='sc'>A Scout Smiles and Whistles</span> under all circumstances.
When he gets an order he should
obey it cheerily and readily, not in a slow,
hang-dog sort of way.</p>
<p class='c009'>Scouts never grouse at hardships, nor whine at
each other, nor swear when put out.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>When you just miss a train, or some one treads
on your favourite corn&mdash;not that a scout ought
to have such things as corns&mdash;or under any
annoying circumstances, you should force yourself
to smile at once, and then whistle a tune,
and you will be all right.</p>

<p class='c010'>A scout goes about with a smile on and whistling.
It cheers him and cheers other people,
especially in time of danger, for he keeps it up
then all the same.</p>

<p class='c010'>The punishment for swearing or using bad language
is for each offence a mug of cold water
to be poured down the offender's sleeve by the
other scouts.</p>
<p class='c007'>9.  <span class='sc'>A Scout is Thrifty</span>, that is, he saves every penny
he can, and puts it into the bank, so that he
may have money to keep himself when out
of work, and thus not make himself a burden
to others; or that he may have money to
give away to others when they need it.</p>

  <h4 class='c012'>SCOUTING GAMES.</h4>
</div>
<h5 class='c012'><span class='sc'>For Winter in the Country.</span></h5>
<h5 class='c012'>ARCTIC EXPEDITION.</h5>
<p class='c004'>Each patrol makes a bob sleigh with ropes, harness,
for two of their number to pull (or for dogs if they have
them, and can train them to the work). Two scouts go
a mile or so ahead, the remainder with the sleigh follow,
finding the way by means of the spoor, and by such signs
as the leading scouts may draw in the snow. All other
drawings seen on the way are to be examined, noted,
and their meaning read. The sleigh carries rations and
cooking-pots, etc.</p>

<p class='c005'>Build snow huts. These must be made narrow,
according to the length of sticks available for forming
the roof, which can be made with brushwood, and
covered with snow.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>SNOW FORT.</h5>
<p class='c004'>The snow fort may be built by one patrol according
to their own ideas of fortification, with loop holes, etc.,
for looking out. When finished it will be attacked by
hostile patrols, using snowballs as ammunition. Every
scout struck by a snowball is counted dead. The
attackers should, as a rule, number at least twice the
strength of the defenders.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>SIBERIAN MAN HUNT.</h5>
<p class='c004'>One scout as fugitive runs away across the snow in
any direction he may please until he finds a good hiding
place, and there conceals himself. The remainder, after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>giving him twenty minutes' start or more, proceed to
follow him by his tracks. As they approach his hiding-place,
he shoots at them with snowballs, and everyone
that is struck must fall out dead. The fugitive must be
struck three times before he is counted dead.</p>
<h5 class='c012'><span class='sc'>In Towns.</span></h5>
<p class='c004'>Scouts can be very useful in snowy weather by
working as a patrol under their leader in clearing
away the snow from pavements, houses, etc. This they
may either do as a "good turn," or accept money to be
devoted to their funds.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>SCOUT MEETS SCOUT.</h5>
<h5 class='c012'><span class='sc'>In Town or Country.</span></h5>
<p class='c004'>Single scouts, or complete patrols or pairs of scouts,
to be taken out about two miles apart, and made to work
towards each other, either alongside a road, or by
giving each side a landmark to work to, such as a steep
hill or big tree, which is directly behind the other party,
and will thus insure their coming together. The patrol
which first sees the other wins. This is signified by the
patrol leader holding up his patrol flag for the umpire to
see, and sounding his whistle. A patrol need not keep
together, but that patrol wins which first holds out its
flag, so it is well for the scouts to be in touch with their
patrol leaders by signal, voice, or message.</p>

<p class='c005'>Scouts may employ any ruse they like, such as climbing
into trees, hiding in carts, etc., but they must not dress
up in disguise.</p>

<p class='c005'>This may also be practised at night.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>DESPATCH RUNNERS.</h5>
<p class='c004'>A scout is sent out to take note of some well-known
spot, say, the post office in a neighbouring town or district.
He will there get the note stamped with the post
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>mark of the office and return. The rest of the scouts
are posted by their leader to prevent him getting there
by watching all the roads and likely paths by which he
can come, but none may be nearer to the post office than
two hundred yards. The despatch runner is allowed to
use any disguise and any method of travelling that he
can hit upon.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the country the game may similarly be played, the
scout being directed to go to a certain house or other
specified spot.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>KIM'S GAME.</h5>
<p class='c004'>Place about twenty or thirty small articles on a tray,
or on the table or floor, such as two or three different
kinds of buttons, pencils, corks, rags, nuts, stones,
knives, string, photos&mdash;anything you can find&mdash;and cover
them over with a cloth or coat.</p>

<p class='c005'>Make a list of these, and make a column opposite the
list for each boy's replies. Like this:</p>

<h5 class='c012'>MORGAN'S GAME.</h5>
<p class='c004'>(Played by the 21st Dublin Co. Boys' Brigade.)</p>
<h4 class='c012'><span class='sc'>In Town.</span></h4>
<p class='c004'>Scouts are ordered to run to a certain hoarding where
an umpire is already posted to time them. They are
each allowed to look at this for one minute, and then to
run back to headquarters and report to the instructor all
that was on the hoarding in the way of advertisements.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>DEBATES, TRIALS, ETC.</h5>
<p class='c004'>A good exercise for a winter's evening in the clubroom
is to hold a debate on any subject of topical interest, the
Instructor acting as chairman. He will see that there is
a speaker on one side prepared beforehand to introduce
and support one view of the subject, and that there is
another speaker prepared to expound another view.
After hearing them, he will call on the others present in
turn to express their views. And in the end he takes
the votes for and against the motion.</p>

<p class='c005'>At first boys will be very shy of speaking unless the
subject selected by the Instructor is one which really
interests them and takes them out of themselves.</p>

<p class='c005'>After a debate or two they get greater confidence,
and are able to express themselves coherently; and also
pick up the proper procedure for public meetings, such
as seconding the motion, moving amendments, obeying
chairman's ruling, voting, according votes of thanks to
chair&mdash;etc., etc.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>In place of a debate a mock trial may be of interest as
a change.</p>

<p class='c005'>For instance, the story of the murder given in <a href='#part1'>Part I</a>.
might form the subject of trial.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Instructor would appoint himself to act the judge,
and detail boys to the following parts:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Prisoner     William Winter.</div>

      <div class='line in3'>"     "  prosecution.</div>
      <div class='line'>Foreman and jury (if there are enough scouts).</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Follow as nearly as possible the procedure of a court
of law. Let each make up his own evidence, speeches,
or cross-examination according to his own notions and
imagination, the evidence to be made up on the lines of
the story, but in greater detail. Do not necessarily find
the prisoner guilty unless the prosecution prove their
case to the jury.</p>

<p class='c005'>In your summing up bring out the fact of the boy
(Hindmarsh) having carried out each part of the duty of
a scout, in order to bring home its lesson to the boys.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>SCOUTS' WAR DANCE.</h5>
<p class='c004'>Scouts form up in one line with leader in front, each
holding his staff in the right hand, and his left on the
next man's shoulder.</p>

<p class='c005'>Leader sings the Ingonyama song. Scouts sing chorus,
and advance to their front a few steps at a time,
stamping in unison on the long notes.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the second time of singing they step backwards.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the third, they turn to the left, still holding each
other's shoulders, and move round in a large circle,
repeating the chorus until they have completed the
circle.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>They then form into a wide circle, into the centre of
which one steps forward and carries out a war dance,
representing how he tracked and fought with one of his
enemies. He goes through the whole fight in dumb
show, until he finally kills his foe. The scouts meantime
still singing the Ingonyama chorus, and dancing on their
own ground. So soon as he finishes the fight, the
leader starts the "Be Prepared" chorus, which they
repeat three times in honour of the scout who has just
danced.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then they recommence the Ingonyama chorus, and
another scout steps into the ring, and describes in dumb
show how he stalked and killed a wild buffalo. While
he does the creeping up and stalking the animal, the
scouts all crouch and sing their chorus very softly, and
as he gets more into the fight with the beast, they similarly
spring up and dance and shout the chorus loudly.
When he has slain the beast, the leader again gives the
"Be Prepared" chorus in his honour, which is repeated
three times, the scouts banging their staffs on the ground
at the same time as they stamp "Bom! bom!"</p>

<p class='c005'>At the end of the third repetition, "Bom! bom!" is
repeated the second time.</p>

<p class='c005'>The circle then close together, turn to their left again,
grasping shoulders with the left hand, and move off,
singing the Ingonyama chorus, or, if it is not desired to
move away, they break up after the final "Bom!
bom!"</p>

  <h4 class='c012'>SCOUTS' PLAY. <br /> POCAHONTAS; or, THE CAPTURE OF CAPTAIN JOHN SMITH.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Scene</span>:</p>

<p class='c005'><i>In the jungle, Virginia, in 1607.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Enter</span>:</p>

<p class='c009'><i>A band of Red Indians,</i> <span class='fss'>R.</span>, <i>scouting. The leading scout
suddenly signals to the others to halt and hide, and remains
himself keenly looking ahead. The</i> <span class='sc'>Patrol Leader</span> <i>creeps
nearer to him, and they speak in a loud whisper</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Patrol Leader</span> (Eagle's Wing). Ho! Silver Fox! What
dost thou see?</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Silver Fox</span> (the leading scout). My leader, I saw but just
now a strange figure ahead&mdash;but for the moment I see it
not. There was an Indian, one of the hated Assock tribe,
and close by him was a being who looked like a man yet
not a man. He wore no feathers, no war paint. But his
body was all hidden in skins or cloths, and his head was
covered with a huge kind of protector. He had, it is true,
two arms and legs, but his face was of a horrible colour&mdash;not
bronze like ours, but an awful white, like that of a dead
man, and half covered with a bush of hair.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Eagle's Wing.</span> It must be either a medicine man or devil.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Silver Fox</span> (<i>still gazing ahead</i>). Look there, he moves!
(<span class='sc'>Patrol Leader</span> <i>springs forward and crouches near</i>
<span class='sc'>Silver Fox</span>.) Close to yonder birch tree. What is it he
carries? A heavy shining staff of iron. See he is
pointing at those ducks with it. Ah!</p>

<p class='c010'>(<i>Report of gun in the distance.</i>)</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Patrol Leader.</span> Scouts! There is the devil before us. He
spits fire and smoke from an iron staff.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Silver Fox.</span> Aye, and see how the birds fall dead before
him.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Patrol Leader.</span> Yes, he is a very devil. What a prize for us
if we can kill him and take his scalp.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Scouts.</span> Nay, nay. He is a devil. He will kill us!</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span><span class='sc'>Silver Fox.</span> Yes, that is true. There is a saying, "Let dogs
that sleep lie sleeping, then they harm you not." Let us
leave this devil so he harm us not.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Scouts.</span> Aye, aye.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Eagle's Wing.</span> Scouts! What woman's talk is this? Are
ye no longer scouts and warriors when ye see a foe? The
worse the foe the greater the glory of defeating him. Are
four Sioux scouts afraid of one, even though he be the
devil himself? Begone to your lodges, but never call
yourselves warriors more. Ye be dogs! Curs but to
harbour such thoughts. For me I am going to have that
scalp&mdash;devil or no devil, I am going to have that scalp!</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Smith.</span>  Well, 'twas a good fight, and you deserve to win for
facing rifle-fire, which you had never seen before. I should
like to shake you by the hand had I a hand free to do
it with. But by St. George, had it not been for this white-livered
knave who dragged me down, there would have
been more of you to join your hunting-party down below.
But who is this who comes?</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>King.</span> How now! Eagle's Wing, what have you here?</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Eagle's Wing.</span> My lord, we have just fought and foiled a
very devil. We killed him not in order that you, our
liege, might have him to see and question and to kill
yourself. (<i>Brings gun.</i>) He used the lightning and
the thunder of Heaven with this engine, so that he killeth
those he hateth. Four of us lie yonder stricken dead
therewith. He is a very devil.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>King</span> to <span class='sc'>Smith</span>. So! What be you? Devil or witch or
Indian painted white? What do you here?</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Smith.</span> Hail, King! I am no witch nor devil&mdash;nothing but a
man&mdash;an Englishman, which is something more than a
mere man. I came across the seas. Five moons it took
me; so far away my country is. But here I am, and
where I am there follow others. And we come to tell you
of a greater King than thou. <i>Our</i> King who is now to be
your king also.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>King</span> (<i>very angry</i>). What! a greater King than I? Knave,
how dare you, whether devil or no&mdash;how dare thou speak
like this?</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>King.</span> Aye, I have heard of these white folk. Art not
afraid?</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Smith.</span> Nay. I have faced the seas and storms, the anger of
the elements, beside which the rage of men is very small.
(<i>Laughing.</i>) Forget not&mdash;I am an Englishman&mdash;an
Englishman knows not fear.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>King.</span> Ho! Say you so? We'll soon put that beyond all
question by a proof. (<i>Draws dagger, rushes on</i> <span class='sc'>Smith</span>
<i>with a yell, as if to stab him, and stops the knife only as it
touches</i> <span class='sc'>Smith's</span> <i>breast</i>. <span class='sc'>Smith</span> <i>does not flinch</i>.) Ah!</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Smith.</span> A joke was it. (<i>Laughs.</i>) By St. George, I thought
you meant to kill me.</p>

He has a noble look. Alas! that he should fall into my
father's power, for he will surely slay him.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>King</span> to <span class='sc'>Smith</span>. And thou wert not afraid?</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span><span class='sc'>Smith.</span> Nay. Why should I be? I have long ago thought
out how to meet my fate. Death and I have looked at
each other face to face before now, and death has a kindly
smile for anyone who has never wilfully done ill to a
fellow creature; to such an one he is no longer a dreaded
demon, but a kindly host.</p>

<p>King Powhattan.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>King.</span> Well! he'll have a guest before long now; for since
you say he is a friend of yours it proves that you are, as
my people first told me, some kind of witch or devil
yourself. Therefore, it will be well for the land that we do
slay thee. Besides, I have not seen a man's red blood
for many days, and I am tired of the blood of the Assocks.
(<span class='sc'>Pocahontas</span> <i>shrinks down, holding her ears</i>.) I shall
dearly like to see how looks the blood of a white half-man,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>half-devil. But first I want to see him cower, and squeal
for mercy; for therein lies the joy of killing. (<i>Calls to
his</i> <span class='sc'>Warriors</span>.) Ho! there! Stretch out this devil on the
ground, and let him learn that death is not the joy he thinks it
is. (<i>They drag</i> <span class='sc'>Smith</span> <i>down, and lay him on his back on the

does not struggle, stand back; two prepare to use their

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Pocahontas</span> (<i>kneeling beside the</i> <span class='sc'>King</span>. <span class='fss'>R.</span>). Oh! King&mdash;I have
not often asked for gifts from you&mdash;and now I pray you,
on my bended knee, to grant me this request. I have no
slave to guard me when I walk abroad. It is not seemly
that I take a young brave of our tribe, and the old ones
are so very old and slow. Now here; a slave of whom
one may be proud&mdash;one strange to see, yet strong and
great and brave. Ah! give him to thy child instead of
unto death.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>King.</span> Nay! nay! my child. If you don't like the scene,
withdraw, for he shall die. 'Tis sport for me to see how
long he lasts before he cries for mercy. And when he
does he dies. (<i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Warriors</span>.) Now stand him up, and
try some new device to make him quail.</p>

<p class='c010'>(<span class='sc'>Pocahontas</span> <i>shrinks back. They raise</i> <span class='sc'>Smith</span>, <i>and he
stands boldly facing them</i>.)</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>King.</span> Death now comes to thee, and thou hast no chance
of escaping him. Art thou not now afraid of him?</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>John Smith.</span> Nay. Why should I be? We men are born
not for ourselves but as a help to others; and if we act
thus loyally we know our God will have us in his care
both now and after death.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>King.</span> But <i>after</i> death you're dead!</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>John Smith.</span> Not so. A Christian lives again.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>King</span> to <span class='sc'>Smith</span>. Well now your hour has come. I know not
what has brought you to this land, but you shall know
that witch or no, your spells can have no power on me;
and you will die, and I shall smile to see you die.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Smith.</span> What brought me here was duty to my King and
God and countrymen; to spread his powerful sway
over all the earth, that you and yours may know of
God, that trade may spread to carry peace and wealth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>throughout the world. If you accept these views all will
be well; if you accept them not then do your worst, but
use your haste; our mission is to <i>clean</i> the world! Kill
me, but that will not avail, for where I fall a thousand
more will come. Know this, O Savage King, a Briton's
word is trusted over all the world; his first care is for
others&mdash;not himself; he sticks to friend through thick
and thin; he's loyal to his King. And though you
threat with death or pains, he'll do his duty to the end.</p>

our King is king of many tribes far greater and more
powerful than your own. But if you join with us your

no crime, no more to steal their goods or beasts, no more
to make them slaves against their will. Beneath the
British flag all men are free. (<span class='sc'>Warriors</span> <i>whisper among

You must be mad or very brave, since I could kill thee at

others just as mad or brave out there, who even now
(<i>points off</i> <span class='fss'>L.</span>) are pressing back your men; and were your
men to kill off all of us, a thousand more will come for
each one killed, and in the end you too would meet your
fate. Know this, that Britain, once she puts her hand to
the plough for doing noble work, does not withdraw, but
presses on till peace and justice are set up, and cruel
wrongs redressed. You would yourself remain as King
among your people, but beneath the friendly wing of
Britain's world-wide power.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>King</span> to <span class='sc'>Warriors</span>. My braves! I never asked your will
before; but ye have heard what this brave man has said.
What think ye? Should we yield or fight this white
man's power?</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Eagle's Wing.</span> My King, we all say "yield," and join this
mighty power, whereby we shall ourselves be strong.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>Instruction in the art of observation and deduction
is difficult to lay down in black and white. It must be
taught by practice. One can only give a few instances
and hints, the rest depends upon your own powers of
imagination and local circumstances.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>The importance of the power of observation and
deduction to the young citizen is great. Children are
proverbially quick in observation, but it dies out as
they grow older, largely because first experiences catch
their attention, which they fail to do on repetition.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Observation</span> <i>is, in fact, a habit to which a boy has
to be trained</i>. <span class='sc'>Tracking</span> <i>is an interesting step towards

reasoning out and extracting the meaning from the
points observed</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>When once observation and deduction have been

of "character" has been gained.</i></p>

<h5 class='c012'>NOTICING SIGN.</h5>
<p class='c004'>"Sign" is the word used by scouts to mean any little
details such as footprints, broken twigs, trampled grass,
scraps of food, a drop of blood, a hair, and so on; anything
that may help as clues in getting the information
they are in search of.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Smithson, when travelling in Kashmir last year,
was following up with some native Indian trackers the
"pugs" of a panther which had killed and carried off a
young buck. He had crossed a wide bare slab of rock
which, of course, gave no mark of his soft feet. The tracker
went at once to the far side of the rock where it came to
a sharp edge; he wetted his finger, and just passed it
along the edge till he found a few buck's hairs sticking
to it. This showed him where the panther had passed
down off the rock dragging the buck with him. Those
few hairs were what scouts call "sign."</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Smithson's tracker also found bears by noticing
small "sign." On one occasion he noticed a fresh
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>scratch in the bark of a tree evidently made by a bear's
claw, and on the other he found a single black hair
sticking to the bark of a tree, which told him that a bear
had rubbed against it.</p>

<p class='c005'>One of the most important things that a scout has to
learn, whether he is a war scout or a hunter or peace
scout, is <i>to let nothing escape his attention</i>; he must
notice small points and signs, and then make out the
meaning of them: but it takes a good deal of practice
before a tenderfoot can get into the habit of really
noting everything and letting nothing escape his eye.
It can be learnt just as well in a town as in the country.</p>

<p class='c005'>And in the same way you should notice any strange
sound or any peculiar smell and think for yourself what
it may mean. Unless you learn to notice "signs" you will
have very little of "this and that" to put together and
so you will be no use as a scout; it comes by practice.</p>

<p class='c005'>Remember, a scout always considers it a great disgrace
if an outsider discovers a thing before he has seen it for
himself, whether that thing is far away in the distance,
or close by under his feet.</p>

<p class='c005'>If you go out with a really trained scout you will see
that his eyes are constantly moving, looking out in
every direction near and far, noticing everything that is
going on, just from habit, not because he wants to show
off how much he notices.</p>

<p class='c005'>I was walking with one the other day in Hyde Park in
London. He presently remarked "that horse is going a
little lame"&mdash;there was no horse near us, but I found he
was looking at one far away across the Serpentine: the
next moment he picked up a peculiar button lying by the
path. His eyes, you see, were looking both far away
and near.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the streets of a strange town a scout will notice his
way by the principal buildings, and side-streets, and in
any case he will notice what shops he passes and what is
in their windows; also what vehicles pass him and such
details as whether the horses' harness and shoes are all
right; and most especially what people he passes, what
their faces are like, their dress, their boots, and their way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>of walking, so that if, for instance, he should be asked by
a policeman, "Have you seen a man with dark over-hanging
eyebrows dressed in a blue suit, going down this
street," he should be able to give some such answer as
"Yes&mdash;he was walking a little lame with the right foot,
wore foreign looking boots, was carrying a parcel in his
hand, he turned down Gold Street, the second turning on
the left from here, about three minutes ago."</p>

<p class='c005'>Information of that kind has often been of greatest
value in tracing out a criminal, but so many people go
along with their eyes shut and never notice things.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the story of "Kim," by Rudyard Kipling, there is
an account of two boys being taught "observation" in
order to become detectives, or scouts, by means of a game
in which a trayful of small objects was shown to them
for a minute and was then covered over and they had to
describe all the things on it from memory.</p>

<p class='c005'>We will have that game, as it is excellent practice for
scouts.</p>

<p class='c005'>There was a revolutionary society in Italy called the
Camorra who used to train their boys to be quick at
noticing and remembering things. When walking
through the streets of the city, the Camorrist would
suddenly stop and ask his boy&mdash;"How was the woman
dressed who sat at the door of the fourth house on the
right in the last street?" or, "What were the two men
talking about whom we met at the corner of the last
street but three?" or, "Where was the cab ordered to
drive to, and what was its number?" "What is the
height of that house and what is the width of its upper
floor window?" and so on. Or the boy was given a
minute to look in a shop window and then he had to
describe all that was in it. Captain Cook, the great
explorer and scout, was trained in the same way as a
boy, and so was Houdin the great conjurer.</p>

<p class='c005'>Every town scout should know, as a matter of course,
where is the nearest chemist's shop (in case of accidents),
the nearest police "fixed point," police-station, hospital,
fire alarm, telephone, ambulance station, etc.</p>

<p class='c005'>The scout must also have his eyes on the ground
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>especially along the edge of the pavement against the
houses or in the gutter. I have often found valuable
trinkets that have been dropped, and which have been
walked over by numbers of people, and swept to one
side by ladies' dresses without being noticed.</p>

<p>How the wearing of a hat shows character.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h5 class='c012'>DETAILS OF PEOPLE.</h5>
<p class='c004'>When you are travelling by train or tram always
notice every little thing about your fellow travellers;
notice their faces, dress, way of talking and so on so
that you could describe them each pretty accurately
afterwards; and also try and make out from their
appearance and behaviour whether they are rich or poor
(which you can generally tell from their boots), and
what is their probable business, whether they are happy,
or ill, or in want of help.</p>

<p class='c005'>But in doing this you must not let them see you are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>watching them, else it puts them on their guard.
Remember the shepherd-boy who noticed the gipsy's
boots, but did not look at him and so did not make the
gipsy suspicious of him.</p>

<p class='c005'>Close observation of people and ability to read their
character and their thoughts is of immense value in trade
and commerce, especially for a shop-assistant or salesman
in persuading people to buy goods, or in detecting
would-be swindlers.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is said that you can tell a man's character from the
way he wears his hat. If it is slightly on one side, the
wearer is good-natured: if it is worn very much on one
side, he is a swaggerer: if on the back of his head, he is
bad at paying his debts: if worn straight on the top, he
is probably honest but very dull.</p>

<p class='c005'>The way a man (or a woman) walks is often a good
guide to his character&mdash;witness the fussy, swaggering
little man paddling along with short steps with much arm-action,
the nervous man's hurried, jerky stride, the slow
slouch of the loafer, the smooth going and silent step of
the scout, and so on.</p>

<p class='c005'>I was once accused of mistrusting men with waxed
moustaches. Well, so, to a certain extent, I do. It often
means vanity and sometimes drink.</p>

<p class='c005'>Certainly the "quiff" or lock of hair which some lads
wear on their forehead is a sure sign of silliness. The
shape of the face gives a good guide to the man's
character.</p>

<p class='c005'>Perhaps you can tell the character of these gentlemen?</p>

<div  class='figcenter id007'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Character of gentlemen.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>I was speaking with a detective not long ago about a
gentleman we had both been talking to, and we were
trying to make out his character. I remarked&mdash;"well, at
any rate, he was a fisherman," but my companion could
not see why: but then he was not a fisherman himself.
I had noticed a lot of little tufts of cloth sticking upon
the left cuff of his coat.</p>

<p class='c005'>A good many fishermen, when they take their flies off
the line, stick them into their cap to dry: others stick
them into their sleeve. When dry they pull them out,
which often tears a thread or two of the cloth.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is an amusing practice when you are in a railway
carriage or omnibus with other people to look only at
their feet and guess without looking any higher what
sort of people they are, old or young, well to do or poor,
fat or thin, and so on, and then look up and see how near
you have been to the truth.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Nat Goodwin, the American actor, once described
to me how he went to see a balloon ascent at a time when
he happened to be suffering from a stiff neck. He was
only able to look down instead of up&mdash;and he could only
see the feet of the people round him in the crowd so he
chose among the feet those that he felt sure belonged to
an affable kind-hearted man who would describe to him
what the balloon was doing.</p>

<p class='c005'>I once was able to be of service to a lady who was in
poor circumstances, as I had guessed it from noticing,
while walking behind her, that though she was well dressed
the soles of her shoes were in the last stage of
disrepair. I don't suppose she ever knew how I
guessed that she was in a bad way.</p>

<p class='c005'>But it is surprising how much of the sole of the boot
you can see when behind a person walking&mdash;and it is
equally surprising how much meaning you can read from
that boot. It is said that to wear out soles and heels
equally is to give evidence of business capacity and
honesty; to wear your heels down on the outside
means that you are a man of imagination and love of
adventure; but heels worn down on the inside signify
weakness and indecision of character, and this last sign
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>is more infallible in the case of man than in that of
woman.</p>

<p class='c005'>Remember how "Sherlock Holmes" met a stranger
and noticed that he was looking fairly well-to-do, in new
clothes with a mourning band on his sleeve, with a
soldierly bearing, and a sailor's way of walking, sunburnt,
with tattoo marks on his hands, and he was carrying
some children's toys in his hand. What should you have
supposed that man to be? Well! Sherlock Holmes
guessed, correctly, that he had lately retired from the
Royal Marines as a Sergeant, and his wife had died, and
he had some small children at home.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>SIGNS ROUND A DEAD BODY.</h5>
<p class='c004'>It may happen to some of you that one day you will
be the first to find the dead body of a man, in which case
you will remember that it is your duty to examine and
note down the smallest signs that are to be seen on and
near the body before it is moved or the ground disturbed
and trampled down. Besides noticing the exact
position of the body (which should if possible be photographed
exactly as found) the ground all round should
be very carefully examined&mdash;without treading on it
yourself more than is absolutely necessary, for fear of
spoiling existing tracks. If you can also draw a little
map of how the body lay and where the signs round it
were, it might be of value.</p>

<p class='c005'>Twice lately bodies have been found which were at
first supposed to be those of people who had hanged
themselves&mdash;but close examination of the ground round
them, in one case some torn twigs and trampled grass,
and in the other a crumpled carpet, showed that
murder had been committed, and that the bodies had
been hung after death to make it appear as though they
had committed suicide.</p>

<p class='c005'>Finger-marks should especially be looked for on any
likely articles and if they do not correspond to those of
the murdered man they may be those of his murderer,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>who could then be identified by comparing the
impression with his fingers. Such a case occurred in
India, where a man was found murdered and a bloody
finger-mark on his clothes. The owner of the finger-mark
was found, tried, and convicted.</p>

<p class='c005'>In St. Petersburg in Russia a banker was found
murdered. Near the body was found a cigar-holder
with an amber mouthpiece. This mouthpiece was of
peculiar shape and could only be held in the mouth in
one position, and it had two teeth marks in it. These
marks showed that the two teeth were of different
lengths.</p>

<p class='c005'>The teeth of the murdered man were quite regular, so
the cigar-holder was evidently not his. But his nephew
had teeth which corresponded to the marks on the
mouthpiece, so he was arrested, and then further proof
came up and showed that he was the murderer.</p>

<p class='c005'>[<i>Compare the story in "Sherlock Holmes' Memoirs"
called "The Resident Patient" in which a man was
found hanging and was considered to be a suicide till
Sherlock Holmes came in and showed various signs
such as cigar ends bitten by different teeth, footprints,
and that three men had been in the room with the dead
man for some time previous to his death and had hanged
him.</i>]</p>
<h5 class='c012'>DETAILS IN THE COUNTRY.</h5>
<p class='c004'>If you are in the country you should notice landmarks,
that is objects which help you to find your way or
prevent you getting lost, such as distant hills, church
towers, and nearer objects such as peculiar buildings,
trees, gates, rocks, etc.</p>

<p class='c005'>And remember in noticing such landmarks that you
may want to use your knowledge of them some day for
telling someone else how to find his way, so you must
notice them pretty closely so as to be able to describe
them unmistakably and in their proper order. You must
notice and remember every by-road and footpath.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>Then you must also notice smaller signs such as birds
getting up and flying hurriedly which means somebody
or some animal is there; dust shows animals, men, or
vehicles moving.</p>

<p class='c005'>Of course when in the country you should notice just
as much as in town all passers-by very carefully&mdash;how
they are dressed, what their faces are like, and their way
of walking, and examine their footmarks&mdash;and jot down
a sketch of them in your notebook, so that you would
know the footmark again if you found it somewhere else&mdash;(as
the shepherd boy did in the story at the beginning
of this book).</p>

<p class='c005'>And notice all tracks&mdash;that is footmarks of men,
animals, birds, wheels, etc., for from these you can read
the most important information, as Captain d'Artagnan
did in the story of the secret duel, of which I shall tell
you later.</p>

<p class='c005'>This track-reading is of such importance that I shall
give you a lecture on that subject by itself.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>USING YOUR EYES.</h5>
<p class='c004'>Let nothing be too small for your notice, a button, a
match, a cigar ash, a feather, or a leaf, might be of great
importance.</p>

<p class='c005'>A scout must not only look to his front but also to
either side and behind him, he must have "eyes at the
back of his head" as the saying is.</p>

<p class='c005'>Often by suddenly looking back you will see an enemy's
scout or a thief showing himself in a way that he would
not have done had he thought you would look round.</p>

<p class='c005'>There is an interesting story by Fenimore Cooper
called "The Pathfinder" in which the action of a Red
Indian scout is well described. He had "eyes at the
back of his head," and after passing some bushes he
caught sight of a withered leaf or two among the fresh
ones which made him suspect that somebody might have
put the leaves there to make a better hiding place, and
so he discovered some hidden fugitives.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>
  <h5 class='c012'>NIGHT SCOUTING.</h5>
</div>
<p class='c004'>A scout has to be able to notice small details just as
much by night as by day and this he has to do chiefly by
listening, occasionally by feeling or smelling.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the stillness of the night sounds carry further than
by day. If you put your ear to the ground or place it
against a stick, or especially against a drum, which is
touching the ground, you will hear the shake of horses'
hoofs or the thud of a man's footfall a long way off.
Another way is to open a knife with a blade at each end,
stick one blade into the ground and hold the other
between your teeth and you will hear all the better.
The human voice, even though talking low, carries to
a great distance and is not likely to be mistaken for any
other sound.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have often passed through outposts at night after
having found where the picquets were posted by hearing
the low talking of the men or the snoring of those asleep.</p>

  <h5 class='c012'>HINTS TO INSTRUCTORS. <br /> HOW TO TEACH OBSERVATION IN PRACTICE.</h5>
</div>
<h5 class='c012'><i>PRACTICES.</i></h5>
<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>In Towns</span>: Practise your boys first in walking down
a street to notice the different kinds of shops as they pass
and to remember them in their proper sequence at the
end.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then to notice and remember the names on the
shops.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then to notice and remember the contents of a shop
window after two minutes' gaze. Finally to notice the
contents of several shop windows in succession with half
a minute at each.</p>

<p class='c005'>The boys must also notice prominent buildings as
landmarks; the number of turnings off the street they
are using; names of other streets; details of horses and
vehicles passing by; and&mdash;especially&mdash;details of the
people as to dress, features, gait; numbers on motor
cars, policemen, etc.</p>

<p class='c005'>Take them the first time to show them how to do it;
and after that send them out and on their return
question them, as below.</p>

<p class='c005'>Make them learn for themselves to notice and
remember the whereabouts of all chemists' shops, fire
alarms, police fixed points, ambulances, etc., etc.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>In the Country</span>: Take the patrol out for a walk and
teach the boys to notice distant prominent features as
landmarks such as hills, church steeples, and so on, and
as nearer landmarks such things as peculiar buildings,
trees, rocks, gates, etc. By-roads or paths, nature of
fences, crops; different kinds of trees, birds, animals,
tracks, etc., also people, vehicles, etc. Also any peculiar
smells of plants, animals, manure, etc.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then send them out a certain walk, and on their
return have them in one by one and examine them
verbally, or have them all in and let them write their
answers on, say, six questions which you give them with
reference to certain points which they should have noticed.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>It adds to the value of the practice if you make a
certain number of small marks in the ground beforehand,
or leave buttons or matches, etc., for the boys to notice
or to pick up and bring in (as a means of making them
examine the ground close to them as well as distant
objects).</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Telling Character</span>: Send scouts out for half an
hour to look for, say, a brutish character, or a case of
genteel poverty, etc.</p>

<p class='c005'>The scout must on his return be able to describe the
person accurately, and give the reasons which made him
think the person was of the character he reports.</p>

<p class='c005'>He should also state how many other characters he
passed in his search, such as silly, good-natured,
deceitful swaggering, wax-moustached, and so on,
judging of course by their faces, their walk, their boots,
hats, and clothing, etc.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>GAMES IN OBSERVATION.</h5>
<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Thimble Finding</span> (Indoors).</p>

<p class='c005'>Send the patrol out of the room.</p>

<p class='c005'>Take a thimble, ring, coin, bit of paper, or any small
article, and place it where it is perfectly visible but in
a spot where it is not likely to be noticed. Let the
patrol come in and look for it. When one of them sees
it he should go and quietly sit down without indicating
to the others where it is.</p>

<p class='c005'>After a fair time he should be told to point it out to
those who have not succeeded in finding it.</p>

<p class='c005'>[This ensures his having really seen it.]</p>
<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Shop Window</span> (Outdoors in town).</p>
<p class='c004'>Umpire takes a patrol down a street past six shops.
Gives them half a minute at each shop, then, after moving
them off to some distance, he gives each boy a pencil
and card, and tells him to write from memory, or himself
takes down what they noticed in, say, the third and fifth
shops. The one who sets down most articles correctly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>wins. It is useful practice to match one boy against
another in heats&mdash;the loser competing again, till you
arrive at the worst. This gives the worst scouts the most
practice.</p>
<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Similar Game</span> (Indoors).</p>
<p class='c004'>Send each scout in turn into a room for half a minute;
when he comes out take down a list of furniture and
articles which he noticed. The boy who noticed most
wins.</p>

<p class='c005'>The simplest way of scoring is to make a list of the
articles in the room on your scoring paper with a column
for marks for each scout against them, which can then
easily be totalled up at foot.</p>
<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Spotting the Spot</span> (Indoors&mdash;town or country).</p>
<p class='c004'>Show a series of photos or sketches of objects, in the
neighbourhood such as would be known to all the scouts
if they kept their eyes open&mdash;such, for instance, as
cross-roads, curious window, gargoyle or weathercock,
tree, reflection in the water (guess the building causing
it), and so on.</p>

<p class='c005'>A pair of scouts can play most of the above
competitions off between themselves, if they like, as a
matter of practice.</p>

<p class='c005'>Patrol leaders can match one pair of their scouts
against another pair in the game, and thus get them
really practised at it, and when they become really good
he can challenge other patrols to compete against his.</p>
<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Follow the Trail.</span></p>
<p class='c004'>Send out a "hare," either walking or cycling, with a
pocketful of corn, nutshells, confetti paper or buttons,
etc., and drop a few here and there to give a trail for the
patrol to follow.</p>

<p class='c005'>Or go out with a piece of chalk and draw the patrol
sign on walls, gateposts, pavements, lamp-posts, trees,
etc., every here and there, and let the patrol hunt you by
these marks. Patrols should wipe out all these marks
as they pass them for tidiness, and so as not to mislead
them for another day's practice.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>The other road signs should also be used, such as
closing up certain roads as not used, and hiding a letter
at some point, giving directions as to the next turn.</p>
<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Scouts' Nose</span> (Indoors).</p>
<p class='c004'>Prepare a number of paper-bags, all alike, and put in
each a different smelling article such as chopped onion
in one, tan in another, roseleaves, leather, aniseed, violet
powder, orange-peel, etc. Put these packets in a row
a couple of feet apart and let each competitor walk
down the line and have five seconds' sniff at each. At
the end he has one minute in which to write down or
to state to the umpire the names of the different objects
smelled, from memory, in their correct order.</p>
<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Far and Near.</span> (For town or country.)</p>
<p class='c004'>Umpire goes along a given road or line of country
with a patrol in patrol formation. He carries a scoring
card with the name of each scout on it.</p>

<p class='c005'>Each scout looks out for the details required and
directly he notices one he runs to the umpire and informs
him or hands in the article if it is an article he finds.
The umpire enters a mark accordingly against his name.
The scout who gains most marks in the walk, wins.</p>

<p class='c005'>Details like the following should be chosen, to
develop the scout's observation and to encourage him
to look far and near, up and down, etc.</p>

<p class='c005'>The details should be varied every time the game is
played; and about 8 or 10 should be given at a time.</p>

<p class='c006'>Men's Tracks&mdash;Animals' Tracks&mdash;How to Learn
Spooring.&mdash;Hints to Instructor&mdash;Tracking Games&mdash;Books
on Spooring.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>MEN'S TRACKS.</h5>
<p class='c004'>General Dodge, of the American Army, describes
how he once had to pursue a party of Red Indians who
had been murdering some people.</p>

<p class='c005'>The murderers had nearly a week's start and had
gone away on horseback. But General Dodge got a
splendid tracking-scout named Espinosa to help him.
The Indians were all riding unshod horses, except one,
and after Espinosa had been tracking them for many
miles he suddenly got off his horse and pulled four
horseshoes out of a hidden crevice in the rocks. The
Indian had evidently pulled them off so that they should
not leave a track.</p>

<p class='c005'>For six days they pursued the band, and for a great
part of the time there was so sign visible to an ordinary
eye, and after going for 150 miles they eventually overtook
and captured the whole party. But it was all
entirely due to Espinosa's good tracking.</p>

<p class='c005'>On another occasion some American troops were
following up a number of Indians, who had been raiding
and murdering whites, and they had some other Red
Indian scouts to assist them in tracking. In order to
make a successful attack, they marched by night, and the
trackers found the way in the darkness by feeling the
tracks of the enemy with their hands, and they went at a
fairly good pace for many miles, merely touching the
track with their fingers; but suddenly they halted and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>reported that the track they had been following had been
crossed by a fresh track, and on the commanding officer
going up, he found the Indians still holding the track
with their hands, so that there should be no mistake.
A light was brought and it was found that the new track
was that of a bear which had walked across the trail of
the enemy! So the march continued without further
incident, and the enemy were surprised, and caught in
the early hours of the morning.</p>

<p class='c005'>The scout, Burnham, in South Africa, who was with
Wilson's party when they were massacred on the
Shangani River in Matabeleland, was sent away with a
dispatch shortly before they were surrounded. He
travelled during the night to escape observation of the
enemy. He found his way by feeling for the tracks left
in the mud by the column when it marched up there in
the morning.</p>

<p class='c005'>I myself led a column through an intricate part of the
Matopo Mountains in Rhodesia by night to attack the
enemy's stronghold which I had reconnoitred the
previous day. I found the way by feeling my own
tracks, sometimes with my hands and sometimes through
the soles of my shoes which had worn very thin; and I
never had any difficulty in finding the line.</p>

<p class='c005'>Tracking, or following up tracks, is called by different
names in different countries. Thus, in South Africa you
would talk only of "spooring," that is, following up the
"spoor"; in India it would be following the "pugs,"
or "pugging"; in America it is "trailing."</p>

<p class='c005'>It is one of the principal ways by which scouts gain
information, and hunters find their game. But to
become a good tracker you must begin young, and
practise it at all times when you are out walking, whether
in town or country.</p>

<p class='c005'>If at first you constantly remind yourself to do it you
will soon find that you do it as a habit without having to
remind yourself. And it is a very useful habit, and
makes the dullest walk interesting.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hunters when they are looking about in a country to
find game first look for any tracks, old or new, to see if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>there are any animals in the country; then they study
the newer marks to find out where the animals are
hiding themselves; then, after they have found a fresh
track, they follow it up till they find the animal and kill
him; and afterwards they often have to retrace their
own tracks to find their way back to camp. And war
scouts do much the same as regards their enemies.</p>

<p class='c005'>First of all you must be able to distinguish one man's
footmark from that of another, by its size, shape, and
nails, etc. And similarly the prints of horses and other
animals.</p>

<p class='c005'>From a man's track, that is, from the size of his foot
and the length of his stride, you can tell, to a certain
extent, his height.</p>

<p class='c005'>In taking notes of a track you should pick out a well-marked
print, very carefully measure its length, length of
heel, with widest point of tread, width at waist, width of
heel, number of rows of nails, and number of nails in
each row, heel and toe-plates or nails, shape of nail-heads,
etc.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is best to make a diagram of the foot-print thus&mdash;nails
missing.</p>
<p class='c004'>You should also measure very carefully the length of
the man's stride from the toe of one foot to the heel of
the other.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Note to Instructor</span>: <i>Make each scout take off his
own boot and draw a diagram of it on paper, putting in
all nails and other points. Or, out of doors, give each
scout the outline ready drawn of a foot-mark, and then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>let him find a foot-mark (or make his own) and fill in
the details of nail-marks, etc.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>Also, he should note down the length of stride taken,
and how much the feet point outwards from the straight
direction of their path.</i></p>

<p class='c005'>A man was once found drowned in a river. It was
supposed that he must have fallen in accidentally, and
that the cuts on his head were caused by stones, etc., in
the river. But some one took a drawing of his boots,
and after searching the river bank came on his tracks,
and followed them up to a spot where there had evidently
been a struggle, the ground being much trampled and
bushes broken down to the water's edge, and the track
of two other men's feet. And though these men were
never found, it showed the case to be one of probable
murder, which would not otherwise have been suspected.</p>

<p class='c005'>A scout must learn to recognise at a glance at what
pace the maker of the tracks was going, and so on.</p>

<p class='c005'>A man walking puts the whole flat of his foot on the
ground, each foot a little under a yard from the other.
In running the toes are more deeply dug into the ground,
and a little dirt is kicked up, and the feet are more than
a yard apart. Sometimes men walk backwards in
order to deceive anyone who may be tracking, but a
good scout can generally tell this at once by the stride
being shorter, the toes more turned in, and the heels
being tightly impressed.</p>

<p class='c005'>With animals, if they are moving fast, their toes are
more deeply dug into the ground, and they kick up the
dirt, and their paces are longer than when going slowly.</p>

<p class='c005'>You ought to be able to tell the pace at which a horse
has been going directly you see the tracks.</p>

<p class='c005'>At a walk the horse makes two pairs of hoof prints&mdash;the
near (left) hind foot close in front of near forefoot mark,
and the off (right) forefoot similarly just behind the
print of the off hindfoot.</p>

<p class='c005'>At a trot the track is similar but the stride is longer.</p>

<p class='c005'>The hind feet are generally longer and narrower in
shape than the forefeet.</p>

<p>Bird tracks.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>These are the tracks of two birds on the ground. One
lives generally on the ground, the other in bushes and
trees. Which track belongs to which bird?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>Native trackers boast that not only can they tell a
person's sex and age by their tracks, but also their
characters. They say that people who turn out their toes
much are generally "liars."</p>

<p class='c005'>It was a trick with highwaymen of old, and with horse
stealers more recently, to put their horses' shoes on wrong
way round in order to deceive trackers who might try to
follow them up, but a good tracker would not be taken in.
Similarly, thieves often walk backwards for the same
reason, but a clever tracker will very soon recognise the
deception.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id007'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Track of (1) Bicycle and (2) Motor.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Wheel tracks should also be studied till you can tell the
difference between the track of a gun, a carriage, a
country cart, motor-car, or a bicycle, <i>and the direction
they were going in</i>. [<i>See diagram.</i>]</p>

<p class='c005'>In addition to learning to recognise the pace of tracks,
you must get to know how old they are. This is
a most important point, and requires a very great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>amount of practice and experience before you can judge
it really well.</p>

<p class='c005'>So much depends on the state of the ground and
weather, and its effects on the "spoor." If you follow
one track, say on a dry, windy day, over varying ground,
you will find that when it is on light, sandy soil it will
look old in a very short time, because any damp earth
that it may kick up from under the surface will dry very
rapidly to the same colour as the surface dust, and the
sharp edges of the footmark will soon be rounded off by
the breeze playing over the dry dust in which they are
formed. When it gets into damp ground, the same
track will look much fresher, because the sun will have
only partially dried up the upturned soil, and the wind
will not, therefore, have bevelled off the sharp edges of
the impression, and if it gets into damp clay, under shade
of trees, etc., where the sun does not get at it, the same
track, which may have looked a day old in the sand, will
here look quite fresh.</p>

<p class='c005'>Of course, a great clue to the age of tracks will often
be found in spots of rain having fallen on them since
they were made (if you know at what time the rain fell),
dust or grass seeds blown into them (if you noticed at
what time the wind was blowing), or the crossing of
other tracks over the original ones, or where the grass
has been trodden down, the extent to which it has since
dried or withered. In following a horse, the length of
time since it passed can also be judged by the freshness,
or otherwise, of the droppings&mdash;due allowance being
made for the effect of sun, rain, or birds, etc., upon them.</p>

<p class='c005'>Having learnt to distinguish the pace and age of
spoor, you must next learn to follow it over all kinds of
ground. This is an accomplishment that you can
practice all you life, and you will still find yourself
learning at the end of it&mdash;you will find yourself continually
improving.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then there is a great deal to learn from the ashes of
fires&mdash;whether they are still warm or cold, scraps showing
what kind of food the people were eating, whether
plentiful or scarce.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>You must not only keep a sharp look out for scout
signs made by your own scouts, but also for those made
by hostile scouts. Foreign scouts also have their private
signs&mdash;as also do tramps. The following are some of the
signs made by tramps on walls or fences near houses
where they have been begging which they chalk up to
warn others of their class:</p>

<p>Bad people.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>There are very good native trackers in the Soudan
and Egypt, and I saw some of their work there.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Colonel of the Egyptian Cavalry had had some
things stolen out of his house, so a tracker was sent for
from the neighbouring Jaalin tribe.</p>

<p class='c005'>He soon found the footprints of the thief and followed
them a long way out on to the desert, and found the
spot where he had buried the stolen goods. His tracks
then came back to the barracks.</p>

<p class='c005'>So the whole of the regiment was paraded without
shoes on for the tracker to examine. And at the end
when he had seen every man walk, he said, "No the
thief is not there." Just then the Colonel's native servant
came up to him with a message, and the tracker who was
standing by said to the Colonel "That is the man who
buried the stolen things."</p>

<p class='c005'>The servant, surprised at being found out, then
confessed that it was he who had stolen his master's
property, thinking that he would be the last man to be
suspected.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Deakin, the Premier of Australia, told me how he
travelled on board ship with a number of natives of
Australia who were on the sea for the first time in their
lives.</p>

<p class='c005'>When the ship got out to sea he noticed all these
natives had got into the bows and were lying flat on the
deck with their heads over the side staring intently into
the water ahead of the ship. So interested were they in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>the water that for some time he could not get any reply
to his question as to what they were looking at, till at
length one of them said: "We cannot understand how the
ship is finding its way across the sea; we cannot see the
trail that it is following; we know that our eyes are sharp
enough on shore and often when we are guiding white
men along a trail they say they cannot see the tracks
which to us are clear enough&mdash;their eyes are different to
ours. But here at sea the English sailors evidently can
see tracks ahead of them, otherwise they would not know
which way to send the ship, and yet we, who are so good
at seeing on shore, cannot see any sign of a track or
mark on the water."</p>

<p class='c005'>When getting on to very fresh spoor of man or beast,
the old scout will generally avoid following it closely
because the hunted animal will frequently look back to
see if it is being followed. The tracker therefore makes
a circle, and comes back on to where he would expect to
find the spoor again. If he finds it, he makes another
circle further ahead till he finds no spoor. Then he
knows he is ahead of his game, so he gradually circles
nearer and nearer till he finds it. See diagram.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>HINTS TO SPOORING.</h5>
<p class='c004'>Some trackers of Scinde followed up a stolen camel
from Karachi to Sehwan, 150 miles over sand and bare
rock. The thieves, to escape detection, drove the camel
up and down a crowded street, in order to get the trail
mixed up with others&mdash;but the trackers foresaw this and
made a "cast" round the town, and hit on the outgoing
spoor on the far side, which they successfully followed up.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id007'>
<img src='images/fig049.jpg' alt='Tracking.' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Tracking.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>In tracking where the spoor is difficult to see, such as on
hard ground, or in grass, note the direction of the last
foot-print that you can see, then look on in the same
direction, but well ahead of you, say 20 or 30 yards, and
in grass you will generally see the blades bent or
trodden, and on hard ground, possibly stones displaced or
scratched, and so on, small signs which, seen in a line
one behind the other, give a kind of track that otherwise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>would not be noticed. I once tracked a bicycle on a
hard macadam road where it really made no impression
at all, but by looking along the surface of the road for a
long distance ahead of me, under the rising sun as it
happened, the line it had taken was quite visible through
the almost invisible coating of dew upon the ground.
Standing on the track and looking upon it close to my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>feet I could not see the slightest sign of it. The great
thing is to look for a difficult track <i>against</i> the sun, so
that the slightest dent in the ground throws a shadow.</p>

<p class='c005'>If you lose sight of the track you must make a "cast"
to find it again. To do this put your handkerchief, staff,
or other mark at the first footmark that you noticed,
then work round it in a wide circle, say 30, 50 or 100
yards away from it as a centre&mdash;choosing the most
favourable ground, soft ground if possible, to find signs
of the outward track. If you are with a patrol it is
generally best for the patrol to halt while one or perhaps
two men make the cast. If everybody starts trying to
find the spoor they very soon defeat their object by
treading it out or confusing it with their own footmarks&mdash;too
many cooks easily spoil the broth in such a case.</p>

<p class='c005'>In making a cast use your common-sense as to which
direction the enemy has probably taken, and try it there.
I remember an instance of tracking a boar which
illustrates what I mean. The boar had been running
through some muddy inundated fields, and was easy
enough to follow until he turned off over some very hard
and stony ground, where after a little while not a sign
of his spoor was to be seen. A cast had accordingly to
be made. The last footmark was marked, and the
tracker moved round a wide circle, examining the ground
most carefully, but not a sign was found. Then the
tracker took a look round the country, and, putting himself
in place of the pig, said "Now which direction would I
have gone in?" Some distance to the front of him, as
the original track led, stood a long hedge of prickly
cactus; in it were two gaps. The tracker went to one
of these as being the line the boar would probably take.
Here the ground was still very hard, and no footmark
was visible, but on a leaf of the cactus in the gap was a
pellet of wet mud; and this gave the desired clue; there
was no mud on this hard ground, but the pig had
evidently brought some on his feet from the wet ground
he had been travelling through. This one little sign
enabled the tracker to work on in the right direction to
another and another, until eventually he got on to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>spoor again in favourable ground, and was able to follow
up the boar to his resting place.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have watched a tracker in the Soudan following
tracks, where for a time they were quite invisible to the
ordinary eye in this way. While the track was clear he
made his own stride exactly to fit that of the track, so
that he walked step for step with it, and he tapped the
ground with his staff as he walked along&mdash;ticking off each
footprint as it were. When the footprints disappeared
on hard ground, or had been buried by drifting sand he
still walked on at the same place tap-tapping the ground
with his staff at the spot where there ought to have been
a footprint. Occasionally one saw a slight depression
or mark which showed that there had been a footprint
there, and thus he knew he was still on the right line.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>HINTS TO INSTRUCTORS. <br /> PRACTICES IN TRACKING.</h5>
<p class='c004'>1.  <i>The Instructor should make his scouts prepare a
well-rolled or flattened piece of ground (about ten or
fifteen yards square) and make one boy walk across it,
then run, and then bicycle across it. Part of the ground
should be wet as if by rain, the other part dry.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>He can then explain the difference in the tracks so
that scouts can tell at once from any tracks they may see
afterwards whether a person was walking or running.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>If possible, a day later make fresh tracks alongside
the old and notice the difference in appearance so that
the scouts can learn to judge the age of tracks.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>Then make tracks of various kinds overrunning each
other such as a bicycle meeting a boy on foot, each going
over the other's tracks, and let the scouts read the meaning.</i></p>

<p class='c005'>2.  <i>Send out a boy with "Tracking Irons" on and let the
patrol track him and notice when any other tracks override
his, showing what people or animals have passed since.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>N.B. Tracking irons are an invention of Mr.
Thompson Seton's and can be strapped on to soles of
scout's boots (like a pair of skates) so that wherever he
goes he leaves a track similar to that of a deer.</i></p>

</div>
<h5 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Track Memory.</span></h5>
<p class='c004'>Make a patrol sit with their feet up so that other
scouts can study them. Give the scouts, say, three
minutes to study the boots. Then leaving the scouts in a
room or out of sight let one of the patrol make some footmarks
in a good bit of ground. Call up the scouts one
by one and let them see the track and say who made it.</p>
<h5 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Track Drawing</span></h5>
<p class='c004'>Take out a patrol; set them on to one foot-track.
Award a prize to the scout who makes the most accurate
drawing of one of the footprints of the track. The
scouts should be allowed to follow up the track till they
get to a bit of ground where a good impression of it can
be found.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>FOR HONOURS.</h5>
<h5 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Spot the Thief.</span></h5>
<p class='c004'>Get a stranger to make a track unseen by the scouts.
The scouts study his track so as to know it again.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then put the stranger among eight or ten others and
let them all make their tracks for the boys to see, going
by in rotation. Each scout then in turn whispers to the
umpire which man made the original track&mdash;describing
him by his number in filing past. The scout who answers
correctly wins; if more than one answers correctly, the
one who then draws the best diagram, from memory, of
the foot-print wins.</p>

<p class='c005'>This game may also be carried out as a test for marks
towards a badge of honour. Correct detection of the
thief counts two marks; if good diagram is also drawn
another mark may be added.</p>

  <h5 class='c012'>"<span class='sc'>Smugglers Over the Border.</span>"</h5>
</div>
<p class='c004'>The "Border" is a certain line of country about four
hundred yards long, preferably a road or wide path or
bit of sand, on which foot-tracks can easily be seen.
One patrol watches the border with sentries posted along
this road, with a reserve posted further inland. This
should be about half-way between the "border" and the
"town," the "town" would be a base marked by trees,
buildings, or flags, etc., about half a mile distant from the
border. A hostile patrol of smugglers assembles about
half a mile on the other side of the border. They will
all cross the border, in any formation they please, either
singly or together or scattered, and make for the town,
either walking or running, or at scout's pace. Only one
among them is supposed to be smuggling, and he wears
tracking irons, so that the sentries walk up and down
their beat (they may not run till after the 'alarm'),
waiting for the tracks of the smuggler. Directly a sentry
sees the track, he gives the alarm signal to the reserve
and starts himself to follow up the track as fast as he
can. The reserve thereupon co-operate with them and
try to catch the smuggler before he can reach the town.
Once within the boundary of the town he is safe and
wins the game.</p>

</div>
<p class='c006'>Putting this and that together&mdash;Sherlock-Holmesism&mdash;Instances
of Deduction&mdash;Hints to Instructors&mdash;Practice
in Deduction&mdash;Books on Deduction.</p>
<p class='c004'>When a scout has learned to notice "sign," he must
then learn to "put this and that together," and so read a
<i>meaning</i> from what he has seen. This is called
"deduction." Here is an example of what I mean which
was lately given in the "Forest and Stream," which
shows how the young scout can read the meaning from
"sign" when he has been trained to it.</p>

<p class='c005'>A cavalry soldier had got lost and some of his
comrades were hunting all over the country to find him,
when they came across a native boy, and asked him if
he had seen the lost man. He immediately said: "Do
you mean a very tall soldier, riding a roan horse that
was slightly lame?"</p>

<p class='c005'>They said, "Yes; that was the man. Where did you
see him?"</p>

<p class='c005'>The boy replied "I have not seen him, but I know
where he has gone."</p>

<p class='c005'>Thereupon they arrested him, thinking that probably
the man had been murdered and made away with, and
that the boy had heard about it.</p>

<p class='c005'>But eventually he explained that he had seen tracks
of the man which he could point out to them.</p>

<p class='c005'>Finally he brought them to a place where the signs
showed that the man had made a halt. The horse had
rubbed itself against a tree, and had left some of its
hairs sticking to the bark which showed that it was a
roan horse; its hoof marks showed that it was lame,
that is, one foot was not so deeply indented on the
ground and did not take so long a pace as the other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>feet. That the rider was a soldier was shown by the
imprint of his boot which was an army boot. Then they
asked the boy "How could you tell that he was a tall
man?" and the boy pointed out to where the soldier had
broken a branch from the tree which would have been
out of reach of a man of ordinary height. Deduction
exactly like reading a book.</p>

<p class='c005'>A boy who has never been taught to read and who
sees you reading from a book would ask "How do you
do it?" and you would point out to him that a number
of small signs on a page are letters; these letters when
grouped form words; and words form sentences; and
sentences give information.</p>

<p class='c005'>Similarly a trained scout will see little signs and
tracks, he puts them together in his mind and quickly
reads a meaning from them such as an untrained man
would never arrive at.</p>

<p class='c005'>And from frequent practice he gets to read the meaning
at a glance just as you do a book without the delay
of spelling out each word, letter by letter.</p>

<p class='c005'>I was one day, during the Matabele war [<i>Show on
map</i>] with a native out scouting near to the Matopo
Hills over a wide grassy plain. Suddenly we crossed a
track freshly made in grass, where the blades of grass
were still green and damp though pressed down; all
were bending one way which showed the direction in
which the people had been travelling; following up the
track for a bit it got on to a patch of sand, and we then
saw that it was the spoor of several women (small feet
with straight edge, and short steps), and boys (small feet,
curved edge and longer strides) walking not running,
towards the hills, about five miles away; where we
believed the enemy to be hiding.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then we saw a leaf lying about ten yards off the track&mdash;There
were no trees for miles, but we knew that trees
having this kind of leaf grew at a village fifteen miles
away, in the direction from which the footmarks were
coming. It seemed likely therefore that the women had
come from that village, bringing the leaf with them, and
had gone to the hills.</p>

<p class='c005'>On picking up the leaf we found it was damp, and
smelled of native beer. The short steps showed that
the women were carrying loads. So we guessed that
according to the custom they had been carrying pots of
native beer on their heads, the mouths of the pots being
stopped up with bunches of leaves. One of these leaves
had fallen out; but we found it ten yards off the track,
which showed that at the time it fell a wind was blowing.
There was no wind now, <i>i.e.</i>, seven o'clock, but there had
been one about five o'clock.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>So we guessed from all these little signs that a party
of women and boys had brought beer during the night
from the village 15 miles away and had taken it to the
enemy on the hills, arriving there soon after six o'clock.</p>

<p class='c005'>The men would probably start to drink the beer at
once (as it goes sour in a few hours), and would, by the
time we could get there, be getting sleepy and keeping a
bad look-out, so we should have a favourable chance of
looking at their position.</p>

<p class='c005'>We accordingly followed the women's track, found the
enemy, made our observations and got away with our
information without any difficulty.</p>

<p class='c005'>And it was chiefly done on the evidence of that one
leaf. So you see the importance of noticing even a little
thing like that.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>INSTANCES OF DEDUCTION.</h5>
<p class='c004'>Mr. Tighe Hopkins writing in "World's Work"
describes how by noticing very small signs detectives
have discovered crimes.</p>

<p class='c005'>In one case a crime had been committed and a
stranger's coat was found which gave no clue to the
owner. The coat was put into a stout bag and beaten
with a stick. The dust was collected from the bag and
examined under a powerful magnifying glass and was
found to consist of fine sawdust which showed that the
owner of the coat was probably a carpenter, or sawyer,
or joiner. The dust was then put under a more powerful
magnifying glass&mdash;called a microscope&mdash;and it was then
seen that it also contained some tiny grains of gelatine
and powdered glue. These things are not used by
carpenters or sawyers, so the coat was shown to belong
to a joiner, and the police got on the track of the
criminal.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dust out of pockets, or in the recesses of a pocket-knife,
and so on, if closely examined, tells a great deal.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then on another occasion a murder was committed,
and close by a cap was found which did not belong to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>the victim, so probably it belonged to the murderer.
Two hairs were found sticking to the lining of the cap;
they were carefully taken to Dr. Emile Pfaff, a
celebrated observer. He examined the hairs under a
microscope and was able to read from them that the
owner of the cap was "A man of middle age, strong,
inclined to be fat; black hair with some grey among it,
getting bald; lately had his hair cut."</p>

<p class='c005'>In this way a clue was got to the appearance of the
murderer.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dr. Bell of Edinburgh is said to be the original from
whom Sir Conan Doyle drew his idea of Sherlock Holmes.</p>

<p class='c005'>The doctor was once teaching a class of medical
students at a hospital how to doctor people. A patient
was brought in, so that the doctor might show how an
injured man should be treated. The patient in this case
came limping in, and the doctor turned to one of the
students and asked him:</p>

<p class='c005'>"What is the matter with this man?"</p>

<p class='c005'>The student replied, "I don't know, sir. I haven't
asked him yet."</p>

<p class='c005'>The doctor said, "Well, there is no need to ask him,
you should see for yourself&mdash;he has injured his right
knee; he is limping on that leg: he injured it by burning
it in the fire; you see how his trouser is burnt away at
the knee. This is Monday morning. Yesterday was
fine; Saturday was wet and muddy. The man's trousers
are muddy all over. He had a fall in the mud on
Saturday night."</p>

<p class='c005'>Then he turned to the man and said, "You drew
your wages on Saturday and got drunk, and in trying to
get your clothes dry by the fire when you got home you
fell on the fire and burnt your knee&mdash;Isn't that so?"</p>

<p class='c005'>"Yes, sir," replied the man.</p>

<p class='c005'>I  saw a case in the paper last week where a judge at
the county court used his powers of "noticing little
things," and "putting this and that together." He was
trying a man as a debtor.</p>

<p class='c005'>The man pleaded that he was out of work, and could
get no employment.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>The judge said&mdash;"Then what are you doing with
that pencil behind your ear if you are not in business?"</p>

<p class='c005'>The man had to admit that he had been helping his
wife in her business, which, it turned out, was a very
profitable one, and the judge thereupon ordered him to
pay his debt.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dr. Reiss, of the Police Department of the University
of Lausanne, records how the police read the spoor.</p>

<p class='c005'>A burglary had taken place in a house, and the thief's
footprints were found in the garden. Those going
towards the house were not so deeply impressed as those
coming away from it nor were they so close together;
from this the police gathered that the burglar had
carried away with him a heavy load which made him
take short steps and he was fully weighted down so that
they sank deeply in the ground.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>HINTS TO INSTRUCTORS. <br /> HOW TO TEACH DEDUCTION IN PRACTICE.</h5>
<p class='c004'><i>Read aloud a story in which a good amount of observation
of details occur, with consequent deductions,
such as in either the "Memoirs" or the "Adventures
of Sherlock Holmes."</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>Then question the boys afterwards as to which details
suggested certain solutions, to see that they really have
grasped the method.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>Follow up ordinary tracks and deduce their meaning.
For examples of daily practice see my book of "Aids to
Scouting."</i></p>
<h5 class='c012'>EXAMPLE OF PRACTICE IN DEDUCTION.</h5>
<p class='c004'>A simple deduction from signs noticed in my walk one
morning on a stony mountain path in Kashmir.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>Sign Observed</i>&mdash;Tree-stump, about three feet high, by
the path. A stone about the size of a cocoanut lying
near it, to which were sticking some bits of bruised
walnut rind, dried up. Some walnut rind also lying on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>the stump. Further along the path, 30 yards to the
south of the stump, were lying bits of walnut shell of
four walnuts. Close by was a high sloping rock, alongside
the path. The only walnut tree in sight was 150
yards north of the stump.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the foot of the stump was a cake of hardened mud
which showed the impression of a grass shoe.</p>

<p class='c005'>What would you make out from those signs? My
solution of it was this:</p>

<p class='c005'>A man had gone southward on a long journey along
the path two days ago, carrying a load; and had rested
at the rock while he ate walnuts.</p>

<p class='c005'>My deductions were these:</p>

<p class='c005'>It was a man carrying a load, because carriers
when they want to rest do not sit down, but rest
their load against a sloping rock and lean back. Had
he had no load he would probably have sat down on the
stump, but he preferred to go 30 yards further to where
the rock was. Women do not carry loads there,
so it was a man. But he first broke the shells of his
walnuts on the tree-stump with the stone, having brought
them from the tree 150 yards north. So he was
travelling south, and he was on a long journey, as he was
wearing shoes, and not going barefooted as he would be
if only strolling near his home. Three days ago there
was rain, the cake of mud had been picked up while the
ground was still wet&mdash;but it had not been since rained
upon and was now dry. The walnut rind was also dry
and confirmed the time that had elapsed.</p>

<p class='c005'>There is no important story attached to this, but it is
just an example of everyday practice which should be
carried out by scouts.</p>
<h5 class='c012'><i>GAMES AND COMPETITIONS IN DEDUCTION.</i></h5>
<p class='c004'><i>Get some people who are strangers to the boys to come
along as passers-by in the street or road, and let the boys
separately notice all about them; and after an interval
ask each for a full description of each of the passers-by
as to appearance, peculiar recognisable points, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>what he guesses his business to be; or let each boy have
two minutes' conversation with your friend and try to
find out what he can about him in that time by
questioning and observation.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>Set a room or prepare a piece of ground with small
signs, tracks, etc., read aloud the story of the crime up
to that point and let each boy or each patrol in turn
examine the scene for a given time and then privately
give each his solution of it.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>The very simplest, most elementary schemes should be
given at first, and they can gradually be elaborated.
For instance take a number of footmarks and spent
matches by a tree showing where a man had difficulty
in lighting his pipe, etc.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>For a more finished theme take a mystery like that in
"Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes" called "The Resident
Patient." Set a room to represent the patient's room
where he was found hanging, with footprints of muddy
boots on the carpet, cigar ends bitten or cut in the fireplace,
cigar ashes, screw-driver and screws, etc. Put
down a strip or "stepping stones" of stuff, handkerchiefs,
or paper on which the competitors shall walk (so as not
to confuse existing tracks). Let each scout (or patrol)
come in separately and have three minutes in which to
investigate. Then to go out and give in his solution,
written or verbal, half an hour later.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>Let one patrol make tracks by carrying out such a
series as that which D'Atagnan elucidated. The other
patrol then acts as detectives and endeavours to unravel
the mystery from the tracks and other sign.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>As an aid to Observation&mdash;How to hide yourself&mdash;How
to learn Stalking&mdash;Games&mdash;Book on Stalking.</p>

<p class='c007'>At some manoeuvres lately, two hostile patrols of
soldiers were approaching, looking for each other, till
the ground between them became very open, and it
seemed hopeless for a scout to cross it without being
seen. However, a small ditch about two feet deep and
overgrown with bushes ran across part of the open plain
from the point where one patrol was lying hidden. They
noticed two calves which came out on to the plain from
the opposite side and walked across the open till they
got to the end of this ditch, and here they stopped and
separated and began browsing.</p>

<p class='c005'>A scout now started to make use of this ditch by
crawling along it till he should get to the far end near
the calves, and there he hoped to find some way of
getting on further, or of at least peeping out and getting
a nearer view of the possible position of the enemy.
When about half-way along the ditch he was suddenly
fired at by an enemy's scout already there, in the ditch.</p>

<p class='c005'>When the umpire rode up and asked him how he had
got there without being seen, the hostile scout said that
finding he could not reach the ditch without being seen
if he went across the plain, he seized two calves which
he had found among the bushes where his patrol were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>hiding, and stepping between them, he drove the pair
of them, by holding their tails across the open ditch;
here he let them go and slid himself into the ditch without
being noticed.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>HOW TO HIDE YOURSELF.</h5>
<p class='c004'>When you want to observe wild animals you have to
stalk them, that is, to creep up to them without their
seeing or smelling you.</p>

<p class='c005'>A hunter when he is stalking wild animals keeps
himself entirely hidden, so does the war scout when
watching or looking for the enemy; a policeman does
not catch pickpockets by standing about in uniform
watching for them, he dresses like one of the crowd
and as often as not gazes into a shop window and sees
all that goes on behind him reflected as if in a looking-glass.</p>

<p class='c005'>If a guilty person finds himself being watched it puts
him on his guard, while an innocent person becomes
annoyed. So when you are observing a person don't do
so by openly staring at them but notice the details you
want to at one glance or two, and if you want to study
them more, walk behind them; you can learn just as
much from a backview, in fact, more than you can from
a frontview, and, unless they are scouts and look round
frequently, they do not know that you are observing
them.</p>

<p class='c005'>War scouts and hunters stalking game always carry
out two important things when they don't want to be
seen.</p>

<p class='c005'>One is&mdash;they take care that the ground behind them,
or trees, or buildings, etc., are of the same colour as
their clothes.</p>

<p class='c005'>And the other is&mdash;if an enemy or a deer is seen
looking for them they remain perfectly still without
moving so long as he is there.</p>

<p class='c005'>In that way a scout even though he is out in the open
will often escape being noticed.</p>

<p class='c005'>In choosing your background, consider the colour of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>your clothes; thus, if you are dressed in khaki, don't go
and stand in front of a white-washed wall, or in front of
a dark-shaded bush, but go where there is khaki-coloured
sand or grass or rocks behind you&mdash;and remain perfectly
still. It will be very difficult for an enemy to distinguish
you even at a short distance.</p>

<p class='c005'>If you are in dark clothes, get among dark bushes, or
in the shadow of trees, or rocks, but be careful that the
ground beyond you is also dark&mdash;if there is light-coloured
ground beyond the trees under which you are standing,
for instance, you will stand out clearly defined against
it.</p>

<p class='c005'>If you are in red, try and get against red brick
buildings, or red earth or rocks, and so on.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Stalking Attitudes.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>In making use of hills as lookout places be very
careful not to show yourself on the top or sky-line.
That is the fault which a Tenderfoot generally makes.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is quite a lesson to watch a Zulu scout making use
of a hill-top or rising ground as a look-out place. He
will crawl up on all fours, lying flat in the grass; on
reaching the top he will very slowly raise his head, inch
by inch, till he can see the view. If he sees the enemy
on beyond, he will have a good look, and, if he thinks
they are watching him, will keep his head perfectly steady
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>for an immense time, hoping that he will be mistaken for
a stump or a stone. If he is not detected he will very
gradually lower his head, inch by inch, into the grass
again, and crawl quietly away. Any quick or sudden
movement of the head on the sky-line would be very
liable to attract attention, even at a considerable
distance.</p>

<p class='c005'>At night keep as much as possible in low ground,
ditches, etc., so that you are down in the dark while an
enemy who comes near will be visible to you outlined
against the stars on higher ground.</p>

<p class='c005'>By squatting low in the shadow of the bush at night,
and keeping quite still, I have let an enemy's scout come
and stand within three feet of me, so that when he
turned his back towards me I was able to stand up
where I was and fling my arms round him.</p>

<p class='c005'>A point also to remember in keeping hidden while
moving, especially at night, is to walk quietly; the thump
of an ordinary man's heel on the ground can be heard a
good distance off, but a scout or hunter always walks
lightly, on the ball of his foot not on his heels; and this
you should practise whenever you are walking by day or
by night, indoors as well as out, so that it becomes a
habit with you&mdash;so as to walk as lightly and silently as
possible. You will find that as you grow into it your
power of walking long distances will grow, you will not
tire so soon as you would if clumping along in the heavy
footed manner of most people.</p>

<p class='c005'>Remember always that to stalk a wild animal, or a
good scout you must keep down wind of him even if the
wind is so slight as to be merely a slight air.</p>

<p class='c005'>Before starting to stalk your enemy then you should
be sure which way the wind is blowing, and work up
against it. To find this out you should wet your thumb
all round with your tongue, and then hold it up and see
which side feels coldest, or you can throw some light
dust, or dry grass or leaves in the air, and see which
way they drift.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Red Indian Scouts when they wanted to reconnoitre
an enemy's camp, used to tie a wolf's skin on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>their backs and walk on all fours, and, imitating the howl
of a wolf, prowled round the camps at night.</p>

<p class='c005'>In Australia the natives stalk emus&mdash;which are great
birds something like an ostrich&mdash;by putting an emu's
skin over themselves and walking with body bent and
one hand held up to represent the bird's head and neck.</p>

<p class='c005'>American scouts when peeping over a ridge or any
place where their head might be seen against the sky
line put on a cap made of wolf's head skin with ears on
it&mdash;so that they may be mistaken for a wolf if seen.</p>

<p class='c005'>Our scouts also when looking out among grass etc.,
tie a string or band round their head and stick a lot of
grass in it, some upright some dropping over their face,
so that their head is very invisible.</p>

<p class='c005'>When hiding behind a big stone or mound, etc., they
don't look over the top but round the side of it.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>HOW TO TEACH STALKING.</h5>
<p class='c004'><i>Demonstrate the value of adapting colour of clothes
to background, by sending out one boy about 500 yards
to stand against different backgrounds in turn, till he
gets one similar in colour to his own clothes.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>The rest of the patrol to watch and to notice how
invisible he becomes when he gets a suitable background,
e.g. a boy in a grey suit standing in front of dark
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>bushes, etc., is quite visible&mdash;but becomes less so if he
stands in front of a grey rock or house; a boy in dark
suit is very visible in a green field but not when he
stands in an open door-way against dark interior
shadow.</i></p>
<h5 class='c012'>GAMES IN STALKING.</h5>
<h5 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Scout Hunting.</span></h5>
<p class='c004'>One scout is given time to go out and hide himself,
the remainder then start to find him, he wins if he is not
found, or if he can get back to the starting point within
a given time without being touched.</p>
<h5 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Despatch Running.</span></h5>
<p class='c004'>A scout is told to bring a note into a certain spot or
house from a distance within a given time: other hostile
scouts are told to prevent any message getting to this
place and to hide themselves at different points to stop
the despatch carrier getting in with it.</p>

<p class='c005'>To count as a capture two scouts must touch the
despatch runner before he reaches the spot for delivering
the message.</p>
<h5 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Stalking.</span></h5>
<p class='c004'>Instructor acts as a deer&mdash;not hiding but standing,
moving a little now and then if he likes.</p>

<p class='c005'>Scouts go out to find and each in his own way tries
to get up to him unseen.</p>

<p class='c005'>Directly the instructor sees a scout he directs him to
stand up as having failed. After a certain time the
instructor calls "time," all stand up at the spot which
they have reached and the nearest wins.</p>

<p class='c005'>The same game may be played to test the scouts in
stepping lightly&mdash;the umpire being blindfolded. The
practice should preferably be carried out where there are
dry twigs lying about, and gravel, etc. The scout may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>start to stalk the blind enemy at 100 yards distance, and
he must do it fairly fast&mdash;say in one minute and a half&mdash;to
touch the blind man before he hears him.</p>
<h5 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Stalking and Reporting.</span></h5>
<p class='c004'>The umpire places himself out in the open and sends
each scout or pair of scouts away in different directions
about half a mile off. When he waves a flag, which is
the signal to begin, they all hide and then proceed to
stalk him, creeping up and watching all he does. When
he waves the flag again, they rise, come in, and report
each in turn all that he did, either by handing in a
written report or verbally as may be ordered. The
umpire meantime has kept a look-out in each direction,
and, every time he sees a scout, he takes two points off
that scout's score. He, on his part, performs small
actions, such as sitting down, kneeling up, and looking
through glasses, using handkerchief, taking hat off for a
bit, walking round in a circle a few times, to give scouts
something to note and report about him. Scouts are
given three points for each act reported correctly. It
saves time if the umpire makes out a scoring card beforehand,
giving the name of each scout, and a number of
columns showing each act of his and what mark that
scout wins, also a column of deducted marks for exposing
themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>Scouts in many parts of the world use the calls of wild
animals and birds for communicating with each other,
especially at night or in thick bush, or in fog, etc., but it
is also very useful to be able to imitate the calls if you
want to watch the habits of the animals. You can begin
by calling chickens; or by talking to dogs in dog
language and you very soon find you can give the angry
growl or the playing growl of a dog. Owls, woodpigeons,
and curlews are very easily called.</p>

<p class='c005'>In India I have seen a certain tribe of gipses who eat
jackals. Now a jackal is one of the most suspicious
animals that lives and is very difficult to catch in a trap,
but these gipsies catch them by calling them in this way.</p>

<p class='c005'>Several men with dogs hide themselves in a grass and
bushes round a small field. In the middle of this open
place one gipsy imitates the call of the jackals calling to
each other; he gets louder and louder till they seem to
come together; then they begin to growl and finally
tackle each other with violent snapping, snarling and
yelling, and at the same time he shakes a bundle of dried
leaves which sounds like the animals dashing about
among grass and reeds. Then he flings himself down
on the ground and throws up dust in the air so that he is
completely hidden in it, still growling and fighting. If
any jackal is within sound of this he comes tearing out
of the jungle and dashes into the dust to join in the fight.
When he finds a man there he comes out again in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>hurry; but meantime the dogs have been loosed from all
sides, and they quickly catch him and kill him.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. William Long in his very interesting book, called
"Beasts of the Field," describes how he once called a
moose. The moose is a very huge kind of stag with a
ugly, bulging kind of nose. He lives in the forests of
North America and Canada, and is very hard to get
near; and is pretty dangerous when he is angry.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Long was in a canoe fishing when he heard a
moose bull calling in the forest&mdash;so just for fun he went
ashore and cut a strip of bark of a birch tree and rolled
it up into a cone or trumpet shape so as to make a kind
of megaphone (about fifteen inches long, five inches wide
at the larger end, and about an inch or two at the
mouth-piece). With this he proceeded to imitate the
roaring grunt of the bull-moose. The effect was
tremendous; the old moose came tearing down and even
came into the water and tried to get at him&mdash;and it was
only by hard paddling that in the end he got away.</p>

<p class='c005'>One of the best things in scouting is the hunting of
big game&mdash;that is going after elephants, lions, rhino, wild
boar, deer, and those kind of animals; and a fellow has to
be a pretty good scout if he hopes to succeed at it.</p>

<p class='c005'>You get plenty of excitement and plenty of danger
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>too; and all that I have told you about observation and
tracking and hiding yourself comes in here. And in
addition to these you must know all about animals and
their habits and ways if you want to be successful.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have said the "hunting" or "going after big game is
one of the best things in scouting." I did not say
shooting or killing the game was the best part; for as
you get to study animals you get to like them more and
more, and you will soon find that you don't want to kill
them for the mere sake of killing, and that the more you
see of them the more you see the wonderful work of God
in them.</p>

<p class='c005'>All the fun of hunting lies in the adventurous life in
the jungle, the chance in many cases of the animal
hunting <i>you</i> instead of you hunting the animal, the
interest of tracking him up, stalking him and watching
all that he does and learning his habits. The actual
shooting the animal that follows is only a very small part
of the fun.</p>

<p class='c005'>No scout should ever kill an animal unless there is
some real reason for doing so, and in that case he
should kill it quickly and effectively, so as to give it as
little pain as possible.</p>

<p class='c005'>In fact many big-game hunters nowadays prefer to
shoot their game with the camera instead of with the
rifle&mdash;which gives just as interesting results&mdash;except
when you and your natives are hungry, then you must, of
course, kill your game.</p>

<p class='c005'>My brother was lately big game shooting in East
Africa and had very good sport with the camera, living
in the wilds, and tracking and stalking and finally snap-shotting
elephants, rhinoceros and other big animals.</p>

<p class='c005'>One day he had crept up near to an elephant and had
set up his camera and had got his head under the cloth
focussing it, when his native cried, "Look out, sir!" and
started to run. My brother poked his head out from
under the cloth and found a great elephant coming for
him, only a few yards off. So he just pressed the button,
and then lit out and ran too. The elephant rushed up
to the camera, stopped, and seemed to recognise that it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>was only a camera after all and smiling at his own
irritability lurched off into the jungle again.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Schillings' book "With Flashlight and Rifle in
Africa" is a most interesting collection of instantaneous
photos of wild animals, most of them taken by night by
means of flashlight, which was set going by the animals
themselves striking against wires which he had put out
for the purpose. He got splendid photos of lions,
hyænas, deer of all sorts, zebras, and other beasts.
There is one of a lion actually in the air springing on to
a buck.</p>

<p class='c005'>The boar is certainly the bravest of all animals; he is
the real "King of Jungle," and the other animals all know
it. If you watch a drinking pool in the jungle at night,
you will see the animals that come to it all creeping
down nervously, looking out in every direction for hidden
enemies. But when the boar comes he simply swaggers
down with his great head and its shiny tusks swinging
from side to side: he cares for nobody, but everybody
cares for him; even a tiger drinking at the pool will give
a snarl and sneak quickly out of sight.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have often lain out on moonlight nights to watch the
animals, especially wild boars, in the jungle; and it is
just as good fun as merely going after them to kill them.</p>

<p class='c005'>And I have caught and kept a young wild boar and a
young panther, and found them most amusing and
interesting little beggars. The boar used to live in my
garden, and he never became really tame though I got
him as a baby.</p>

<p class='c005'>He would come to me when I called him&mdash;but very
warily; he would never come to a stranger, and a
native he would "go for" and try and cut him with his
little tusks.</p>

<p class='c005'>He used to practise the use of his tusks while turning
at full speed round on old tree stump in the garden, and
he would gallop at this and round it in a figure-of-eight
continuously for over five minutes at a time, and then
fling himself down on his side, panting with his
exertions.</p>

<p class='c005'>My panther was also a beautiful and delightfully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>playful beast, and used to go about with me like a dog;
but he was very uncertain with his dealings with
strangers.</p>

<p class='c005'>I think one gets to know more about animals and to
understand them better by keeping them as pets at first,
and then going and watching them in their wild natural
life.</p>

<p class='c005'>But before going to study big game in the jungles
everybody must study all animals wild and tame at
home. It would be a very good thing if every scout
kept some kind of animal such as a pony or a dog,
or even birds, rabbits, or even live butterflies.</p>

<p class='c005'>Every boy scout ought to know all about the tame
animals which he sees every day. You ought to know
all about grooming, feeding, and watering a horse,
about putting him into harness or taking him out of
harness and putting him in the stable, and know when
he is going lame and should not therefore be worked.</p>

<p class='c005'>And when you harness a horse I hope you will show
more knowledge of the animal and more kindness
towards him than do half the carriage coachmen in
London&mdash;by not putting bearing reins on him.</p>

<p class='c005'>Prince Edward of Wales was reported a short time
ago to have said as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class='c005'>"When I am King I shall make three laws:</p>

<p class='c009'>1. That no one shall cut puppies' tails, because it
must hurt them so.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. That there shall be no more sin in the country.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. That nobody shall use bearing-reins because they
hurt the horses."</p>

<p class='c007'>These laws not only show us that King Edward VIII.
will be a kind and humane monarch, but that he is
farseeing, for the last one at any rate might well be a
law of the country now. It is much needed.</p>

<p class='c005'>Bearing reins are small extra reins which are hooked
on to the horse's collar to hold up his head. They
are generally put on so tightly as to cause him pain
the moment he droops his head at all; when put on
loosely they do not cause him to hold up his head
and therefore are not of any use.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>There are no better drivers than the London cabbies
and 'busmen, and they do not use bearing reins, and
their horses are more handy than those usually seen in
carriages.</p>

<p class='c005'>Sometimes you see them used on horses in heavy carts;
they are then called "Hame-reins"&mdash;but they are cruel
on the horse if tightly tied. A horse when pulling a
heavy cart wants to lean forward with his head down,
just as you or I would do when pulling a garden roller&mdash;but
this hame-rein pulls at the corners of his mouth and
forces him to keep his head up.</p>

<p class='c005'>I saw lately a man in charge of a loaded cart whose
horse was thus tied up. He wanted to get the cart
through some heavy mud (it was on the new Mall from
Buckingham Palace to Charing Cross) and the horse tried
to lean forward to pull but could not. The man beat
him for not trying&mdash;the poor beast in his pain and terror
reared up on his hind legs, and the man beat him again
for "showing temper."</p>

<p class='c005'>When I saw it I felt inclined to beat the man, but I
went up and said I thought I could make the horse do it.
The man grinned while I was undoing the hame-rein and
said I should have to get another horse to do it then.
But when the horse found his head free and I smacked
him on the back, he flung the whole of his weight into
the collar with his head well down, and with both hind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>toes dug into the ground he heaved the cart forward a
few inches, and then again a few more, and not many
seconds later had it all safe on the hard road.</p>

<p class='c005'>Often you can help a horse struggling with a load on a
slippery road by scattering a few handfuls of sand or
ashes. Miss Lisette Rest used to do this in London and
when she died she left money for that purpose.</p>

<p class='c005'>Other tame animals to understand are, of course, dogs.
And a good dog is the very best companion for a scout,
who need not think himself a really good scout till he
has trained a young dog to do all he wants of him. It
requires great patience and kindness, and genuine
sympathy with the dog.</p>

<p class='c005'>A dog is the most human of all animals and, therefore
the best companion for a man. He is always courteous,
and always ready for a game&mdash;full of humour, and very
faithful and loving.</p>

<p class='c005'>Of course a scout who lives in the country has much
better chances of studying animals and birds than one
who lives in a town.</p>

<p class='c005'>Still if you live in London there are lots of different
kinds of birds in the parks, ducks and waterfowl of every
kind, pelicans, woodpigeons, woodpeckers, and most of
the English birds; there is almost every animal under
the sun to be seen alive in the Zoological Gardens, or
stuffed and set up in the Natural History Museum at
South Kensington&mdash;so that a Boy Scout in London ought
to know as much about all animals as most people. And
even in Leadenhall Market you can see a number of
different kinds of live animals for sale, as well as in the
many animal shops about London or any other big town.</p>

<p class='c005'>In other towns it is perhaps a little more difficult, but
most of them have their Natural History Museum where
a fellow can learn the appearance and names of many
animals; and you can do a lot of observing in the parks
or by starting a feeding-box for birds at your own
window. And, best of all, by going out into the country
whenever you can get a few hours for it by train, or
bicycle or on your own flat feet, and there to stalk such
animals as rabbits, hares, water-rats, birds, fish, etc., and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>watch all they do, and get to know their different kinds
and their names, and also what kind of tracks they
make on the ground, their nests and eggs, and so on.</p>

<p class='c005'>If you are lucky enough to own a camera you cannot
possibly do better than start making a collection of
photos of animals and birds taken from life. Such a
collection is ten times more interesting than the ordinary
boy's collection of stamps, or crests, or autographs,
which any ass can accomplish by sitting at home and
bothering other people to give.</p>

<p class='c005'>And cameras can be got very cheaply now: it only
means saving up money in a money-box for a short time.</p>

<p class='c005'>The wild animals I shall talk of now are those which
you find in Great Britain. Any scouts who live in the
Colonies or elsewhere must make up their own lists for
themselves.</p>

<p class='c005'>As a scout you should study the habits of as many of
these animals as you can:&mdash;</p>

<p class='c007'>Every animal is interesting to watch and it is just as
difficult to stalk a weasel as it is to stalk a lion. Even
the humble hedgehog can be a hero among animals.
Here is a description of a fight between a hedgehog and
a viper by Mr. Millais in his book on the "Mammals of
Great Britain and Ireland." (Mammals mean animals
that have "Mammas"&mdash;that is, they are born alive, not
like chickens in eggs that have to be hatched&mdash;birds are
not mammals.)</p>

<p class='c005'>"Everyone knows that the hedgehog is a sworn enemy
of reptiles in general and of the viper in particular; but
few, perhaps, are aware in what way he overcomes so
dangerous an enemy.</p>

<p class='c005'>"My keeper was going his rounds this summer in a
wood which was infested by vipers when he espied an
enormous one asleep in the sun. He was on the point
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>of killing it with a charge of shot, when he perceived a
hedgehog coming cautiously over the moss and noiselessly
approaching the reptile. He then witnessed a
curious sight. As soon as the hedgehog was within
reach of his prey, he seized it by the tail with his teeth
and as quick as thought rolled himself into a ball. The
viper, awakened by the pain, at once turned and made a
terrific dart at him. The hedgehog did not wince. The
viper, infuriated, extends itself, hisses and twists in
fearful contortions. In five minutes it is covered with
blood, its mouth one large wound (from the spines of the
hedgehog), and it lies exhausted on the ground.</p>

<p class='c005'>"A few more starts, and then a last convulsive agony,
and it expires.</p>

<p class='c005'>"When the hedgehog perceived that it was quite dead
he let go his hold and quietly unrolled himself. He was
just about to begin his meal and devour the reptile when
the sight of my keeper, who had approached during the
struggle, alarmed him, and he rolled himself up again till
the man had retreated into the wood."</p>

<p class='c005'>We are apt to think that all animals are guided in
their conduct by instinct, that is by a sort of idea
that is born in them. For instance, we imagine that
a young otter swims naturally directly he is put into
water, or that a young deer runs away from a man
from a natural inborn fear of him.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. W. Long in his book "School of the Woods"
shows that animals largely owe their cleverness to
their mothers who teach them while yet young. Thus
he has seen an otter carry two of her young upon her
back into the water, and after swimming about for a
little while she suddenly dived from under them and
left them struggling in the water. But she rose near
them and helped them to swim back to the shore.
In this way she gradually taught them to swim.</p>

<p class='c005'>I once saw a lioness in East Africa sitting with her
four little cubs all in a row watching me approaching
her. She looked exactly as though she were teaching
her young ones how to act in the case of a man
coming.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>She was evidently saying to them, "Now, cubbies, I
want you all to notice what a white man is like. Then,
one by one, you must jump up and skip away, with a
whisk of your tail. The moment you are out of sight in
the long grass you must creep and crawl till you have
got to leeward (down-wind) of him; then follow him,
always keeping him to windward, so that you can smell
whereabouts he is and he cannot find you."</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Teaching the Youngsters.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>In "The School of the Woods," Long writes:</p>

<p class='c005'>"Watch, say, a crow's nest. One day you will see
the mother bird standing near the nest and stretching
her wings over her little ones. Presently the young
stand up and stretch their wings in imitation. That is
the first lesson.</p>

<p class='c005'>"Next day, perhaps, you will see the old bird lifting
herself to tip-toe and holding herself there by vigorous
flapping. Again the young imitate and soon learn that
their wings are a power to sustain them. Next day you
may see both parent birds passing from branch to branch
about the nest aided by their wings in the long jumps.
The little ones join and play and, lo! they have learned
to fly without even knowing that they were being
taught."</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>
  <h5 class='c012'>BIRDS.</h5>
</div>
<p class='c004'>A man who studies birds is called an ornithologist.
Mark Twain, the amusing, yet kind-hearted, American
writer, says: "There are fellows who write books about
birds and love them so much that they'll go hungry and
tired to find a new kind of bird&mdash;and kill it.</p>

<p class='c005'>"They are called 'ornithologers.'</p>

<p class='c005'>"I could have been an 'ornithologer' myself, because
I always loved birds and creatures. And I started out
to learn how to be one. I see a bird sitting on a dead
limb of a high tree, singing away with his head tilted
back and his mouth open&mdash;and before I thought I fired
my gun at him; his song stopped all suddenly, and he
fell from the branch, limp like a rag, and I ran and
picked him up&mdash;and he was dead: his body was warm
in my hand, and his head rolled about this way and that,
like as if his neck was broke, and there was a white skin
over his eyes, and one drop of red blood sparkled on the
side of his head&mdash;and&mdash;laws! I couldn't see nothing for
the tears. I haven't ever murdered no creature since
then that warn't doing me no harm&mdash;and I ain' agoing
to neither."</p>

<p class='c005'>A good scout is generally a good "ornithologer" as
Mark Twain calls him. That is to say he likes stalking
birds and watching all that they do. He discovers
by watching them where and how they build their
nests.</p>

<p class='c005'>He does not, like the ordinary boy, want to go and
rob them of their eggs, but he likes to watch how they
hatch out their young and teach them to feed themselves
and to fly. He gets to know every species of
bird by its call and by its way of flying; and he knows
which birds remain all the year round and which only
come at certain seasons; and what kind of food they
like best, and how they change their plumage; what sort
of nests they build, where they build them, and what the
eggs are like.</p>

<p class='c005'>There are 177 different kinds of birds in Great Britain.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>Here are some of the commoner birds which a scout
should know by sight and sound:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Wood pigeon      Heron      Jackdaw</div>
      <div class='line'>Pheasant         Wren       Rook</div>
      <div class='line'>Partridge        Wagtail    Crow</div>
      <div class='line'>Grouse           Swallow    Raven</div>
      <div class='line'>Cuckoo           Martin     Thrush</div>
      <div class='line'>Skylark          Woodpecker Blackbird</div>
      <div class='line'>Snipe            Gull       Tit</div>
      <div class='line'>Wild duck        Tern       Finch</div>
      <div class='line'>Plover           Owl        Woodcock</div>
      <div class='line'>Wild goose       Hawk       Curlew</div>
      <div class='line'>Robin            Falcon     Kingfisher</div>
      <div class='line'>Starling         Moorhen</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>A good deal of natural history can even be studied by
keeping birds in your houses, or watching them in your
neighbourhood, especially if you feed them daily in
winter. It is interesting to note, for instance, their
different ways of singing, how some sing to make love to
the hen birds, while others, like the barndoor cock, crow
or sing to challenge another to fight. A herring gull
makes an awful ass of himself, when he tries to sing and
to show himself off to the ladies, and an old crow is not
much better. Then it is interesting to watch how the
young birds hatch out; some appear naked with no
feathers and their eyes shut and their mouths open.
Others, with fluffy kind of feathers all over them, are full
of life and energy. Young moorhens, for instance, swim
as soon as they come out of the egg; young chickens
start running about and hunting flies within a very few
minutes; while a young sparrow is useless for days, and
has to be fed and coddled by his parents.</p>

<p class='c005'>There are over forty different kinds of birds which
visit England from abroad, especially from India and
Africa, at certain times of the year, chiefly in April, such
as the sand martin, swallow, house martin, nightingale,
hobby falcon, cuckoo, corncrake, and swift.</p>

<p class='c005'>A good many birds are almost dying out in Great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>Britain, because so many boys bag all their eggs when
they find their nests.</p>

<p class='c005'>Birds'-nesting is very like big game shooting&mdash;you look
out in places that, as a hunter, you know are likely
places for the birds you want; you watch the birds fly
in and out and you find the nest. But do not then go
and destroy the nest and take all the eggs. If you are
actually a collector, take one egg and leave the rest, and,
above all, don't pull the nest about, otherwise the parent
birds will desert it, and all those eggs which might have
developed into jolly young birds will be wasted.</p>

<p class='c005'>Far better than taking the eggs is to take a photo or make
a sketch of the hen sitting on her nest, or to make a
collection of pictures of the different kinds of nests,
made by the different kinds of birds.</p>

<p class='c005'>Aberdeen in Scotland is supposed to be specially well
off for skylarks, for the following reason.</p>

<p class='c005'>A few years ago there came a very severe gale and
snowstorm late in March&mdash;and all the high ground inland
was so buried under snow and ice, that the birds were all
driven to the lower land near the coast. The fields by
the seashore were covered with them.</p>

<p class='c005'>Numbers of people went out to catch them with bird-lime,
nets, snares, and guns. Large numbers were taken
alive to be sent to market in London and other towns.</p>

<p class='c005'>One gentleman found a man selling a big cage full of
them. They were crowded up to a fearful extent
and all fluttering with terror at their imprisonment,
struggling over each other in their frantic desire to
escape. He felt so sorry for them that he bought the
whole lot and took them to his warehouse where he was
able to give them plenty of room and food and water.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then he offered to buy all the larks that were being
captured for the market at market prices. In this way he
received over a thousand&mdash;and these he put in a big room
where they had comparative freedom and plenty of food.
It is said that the noise of their singing in the morning
was almost deafening and crowds of birds used to gather
over the house to hear them.</p>

<p class='c005'>At last the bad weather passed off, the sun shone out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>again and the fields became green and bright, and then
the kind man who had housed the birds opened the
windows of the room and all the birds flew out in a happy
crowd chirping and singing as they mounted into the
bright warm air or fluttered off to the adjoining fields and
woods. And there they build their nests and hatched
out their young so that to-day the song of the lark is to
be heard everywhere round Aberdeen.</p>

<p class='c005'>Through ignorance of natural history many keepers
and others see no difference between sparrow-hawks,
merlins, and kestrels, and destroy all of them as mischievous
to game. Sparrow-hawks and merlins do, no
doubt, kill young game, but a kestrel hardly ever, if
ever. He lives principally on field mice. You can tell
him by his flight&mdash;he spends much of his time hovering
in the air looking out with his sharp eyes for a mouse
upon which to swoop down. The sparrow-hawk flits in
and out round rocks and over fences hoping thus to
come on prey by surprise. The merlin is a very small
but very plucky little hawk and hunts down his prey by
fast flying.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>REPTILES AND FISHES.</h5>
<p class='c004'>The more usual reptiles in Great Britain are:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Grass Snake.</div>
      <div class='line'>Viper.</div>
      <div class='line'>Frog.</div>
      <div class='line'>Toad.</div>
      <div class='line'>Lizard.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The commoner fishes are:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Trout.</div>
      <div class='line'>Grayling.</div>
      <div class='line'>Perch.</div>
      <div class='line'>Roach.</div>
      <div class='line'>Dace.</div>
      <div class='line'>Chub.</div>
      <div class='line'>Bream.</div>
      <div class='line'>Pike.</div>
      <div class='line'>Minnow.</div>
      <div class='line'>Salmon.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>and a number of sea fish.</p>

<p class='c005'>Every scout ought to be able to fish in order to get
food for himself. A tenderfoot who starved on the bank
of a river full of fish would look very silly, yet it might
happen to one who had never learnt to catch fish.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>And fishing brings out a lot of the points in scouting,
especially if you fish with a fly. To be successful you
must know a lot about the habits and ways of the fish,
what kind of haunt he frequents, in what kind of weather
he feeds, and at what time of day, which kind of food he
likes best, how far off he can see you, and so on. Without
knowing these you can fish away until you are blue
in the face and never catch one.</p>

<p class='c005'>A fish generally has his own particular haunt in the
stream and when once you discover a fish at home you
can go and creep near and watch all that he does.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then you have to be able to tie very special knots
with delicate gut&mdash;which is a bit of a puzzler to any boy
whose fingers are all thumbs.</p>

<p class='c005'>And you have to have infinite patience; your line gets
caught up in bushes and reeds, or your clothes&mdash;or when
it can't find any other body it ties itself up in a knot
round itself. Well, it's no use getting angry with it.
There are only two things to do&mdash;the first is to grin a
smile, and the second is to set to work, very leisurely, to
undo it. Then you will have loads of disappointments
in losing fish through the line breaking, or other
mishaps; but remember those are what happen to everybody
when they begin fishing and are the troubles that
in the end make it so very enjoyable when you have got
over them.</p>

<p class='c005'>And when you catch your fish, do as I do&mdash;only keep
those you specially want for food or as specimens; put
back the others the moment you have landed them. The
prick of the hook in their leathery mouth does not hurt
them permanently, and they swim off quite happily to
enjoy life in their water again.</p>

<p class='c005'>If you use a dry fly, that is keeping your fly sitting on
top of the water instead of sunk under the surface, you
have to really stalk your fish just as you would deer or
any other game, for a trout is very sharp-eyed and shy.</p>

<p class='c005'>You can also catch fish by netting, or, as scouts often
have to do, by spearing them with a very sharp three-pronged
spear. I have done it many a time, but it
requires practice to be successful.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>A scout, of course, has to look at animals of all sorts,
partly with an eye to their being useful to him sometime
or another for food. Reptiles don't look tempting as food
but, once you have tasted frogs legs nicely cooked, you
will want more of them.</p>

<p class='c005'>I believe that fried snake, like fried eel, is not half
bad.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have eaten the huge kind of lizard called an iguana.
He had his head and tail cut off to enable him to go
into the cooking pot, and when he was boiled and put
on the table he looked exactly like a headless baby with
his arms and legs and little hands. And when we ate
him he tasted just like a baby too. Well&mdash;you know
what a baby tastes like&mdash;sort of soft chicken flavoured
with violet-powder!</p>

<div  class='figcenter id008'>
<img src='images/fig057.jpg' alt='A Viper (or Adder) has this marking on his head and neck; other snakes have none&mdash;in Great Britain.' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>A Viper (or Adder) has this marking on his head and neck; other snakes have none&mdash;in Great Britain.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>As far as snakes go, there are not, fortunately,
many poisonous ones in England&mdash;only the viper is
poisonous. It is differently marked from other snakes
having a black V or arrow-head mark on its head and a
dark zig-zag line along its back. It is generally dark
brown in colour. The viper is sometimes called adder.</p>

<p class='c005'>Of course a scout ought to know about snakes because
in almost all wild countries you come across plenty of
them and many of them dangerous.</p>

<p class='c005'>They have a horrid knack of creeping into tents and
under blankets, or into boots. You will always notice
an old hand in camp before he turns in at night look
very carefully through his blankets, and in the morning
before putting on his boots he will carefully shake them
out. I even find myself doing it now in my bedroom at
home, just from habit.</p>

<p class='c005'>Snakes don't like crawling over anything rough as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>rule; so in India you often construct a kind of path made
of sharp jagged stones all round a house to prevent
snakes crawling into it from the garden.</p>

<p class='c005'>And on the prairie hunters sometimes lay a hair rope
on the ground in a circle round their blankets.</p>

<p class='c005'>A hair rope has so many tiny spikes sticking out of it
that it tickles the snake's tummy to such an extent he
cannot go over it.</p>

<p class='c005'>I used to catch snakes when I was at school, by using
a long stick with a small fork at the end of it. When I
saw a snake I stalked him, jammed the fork down on
his neck, and then tied him up the stick with strips of
old handkerchief, and carried him back to sell to anybody
who wanted a pet. But they are not good things
to make pets of as a rule because so many people have a
horror of them, and it is not fair, therefore, to have them
about in a house where servants or others might get
frightened by them.</p>

<p class='c005'>Poisonous snakes carry their poison in a small kind of
bag inside their mouths. They have two fangs or long
pointed teeth, which are on a kind of hinge; they lie
flat along the snake's gums till he gets angry and wants
to kill something; then they stand on end, and he dives
his head forward and strikes them into his enemy. As he
does so the poison passes out of the poison bag, or gland
as it is called, into the two holes in your skin made by the
fangs. This poison then gets into the veins of the man
who has been bitten and is carried by the blood all over
the body in a few seconds, unless steps are at once
taken to stop it by sucking the wound and binding the
veins up very tightly.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>INSECTS.</h5>
<p class='c004'>Insects are very interesting animals to collect, or to
watch, or to photograph.</p>

<p class='c005'>Also for a scout who fishes, or studies birds, or reptiles,
it is most important that he should know a certain
amount about the insects which are their favourite food
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>at different times of the year or different hours of the
day.</p>

<p class='c005'>The usual insects about which a scout ought to know
something, are:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Moths.</div>
      <div class='line'>Gnats.</div>
      <div class='line'>Beetles.</div>
      <div class='line'>Grasshoppers.</div>
      <div class='line'>Ants.</div>
      <div class='line'>Spiders.</div>
      <div class='line'>Glow-worms.</div>
      <div class='line'>Butterflies.</div>
      <div class='line'>Lice.</div>
      <div class='line'>Bees and wasps.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>About bees alone whole books have been written&mdash;for
they have wonderful powers in making their
honeycomb, in finding their way for miles&mdash;sometimes
as far as six miles&mdash;to find the right kind of flowers for
giving them the sugary juice for making honey, and
getting back with it to the hive.</p>

<p class='c005'>They are quite a model community, for they respect
their Queen and kill their unemployed.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then some insects are useful as food. Ants make a
substitute for salt. Locusts&mdash;a big kind of grasshopper&mdash;are
eaten in India and South Africa. We were very
glad to get a flight or two of them over Mafeking.
When they settled on the ground we went, and with
empty sacks, beat them down as they tried to rise.
They were then dried in the sun and pounded up
and eaten.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>HINTS FOR INSTRUCTOR.</h5>
<h5 class='c012'><i>PRACTICES.</i></h5>
<p class='c004'><i>Set your scouts to find out by observation, and to
report on such points as these:</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>In Country</span>: <i>How does a wild rabbit dig his hole?
When a lot of rabbits are alarmed does a rabbit merely
run because the others do, or does he look round and
see what is the danger before he goes, too?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>Does a woodpecker break the bark away to get at
insects on a tree trunk, or does he pick them out of
holes, or how does he get at them?</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span><i>Does a trout when disturbed by people passing along
the bank, go up or down stream? Does he go away
altogether, or return to his place? How long does he
stay away? etc.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>In Town</span>: <i>Make your scouts go out and report if
they see a lame horse or one with collar gall or sore
mouth or tight bearing-rein.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>Patrol to make a beehive or two, and put in queen
bees or swarms, and start bee-farming for profit.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>Scouts make lures, traps, snares, etc., and set them
(not on preserved ground) to catch birds and animals
for food.</i></p>
<h5 class='c012'>HONOURS.</h5>
<p class='c004'>The following marks can be gained in this section by
First Class Scouts towards Badge of Honour.</p>

<p class='c005'>For drawing correctly the foot-tracks of twelve
different animals or birds, 3 marks.</p>

<p class='c005'>Name twelve different kinds of fish and describe the
points by which they may be recognised, up to 2 marks.
The same illustrated by drawings, or models in clay, up
to 4 marks.</p>

<p class='c005'>Photos or sketches from life of twelve wild animals,
birds, reptiles, &amp;c., with short description of about
twenty words each. Taken and developed, or drawn by
the scout himself, up to 5 marks.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>LION HUNTING.</h5>
<p class='c004'>A lion is represented by one scout who goes out with
tracking irons on his feet, and a pocketful of corn or
peas, and six tennis balls. He is allowed half an hour's
start, and then the patrol go after him, following his
spoor, each armed with one tennis ball with which to
shoot him, when they find him. The lion may hide or
creep about or run just as he feels inclined, but whenever
the ground is hard or very grassy, he must drop a
few grains of corn, every few yards to show the trail.</p>

<p class='c005'>If the hunters fail to come up to him neither wins the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>game. When they come near to his lair the lion fires at
them with his tennis balls, and the moment a hunter is
hit he must fall out dead and cannot throw his tennis
ball. If the lion gets hit by a hunting tennis ball he is
wounded, and if he gets wounded three times he is killed.</p>

<p class='c005'>Tennis balls may only be fired once; they cannot be
picked up and fired again in the same fight.</p>

<p class='c005'>Each scout must collect and hand in his tennis balls
after the game. In winter if there is snow, this game
can be played without tracking irons, and using snowballs
instead of tennis balls.</p>

<h5 class='c012'>TREES.</h5>
<p class='c004'>Although they are not animals, trees are things about
which scouts should know something. Very often a
scout has to describe country which he has seen, and if
he says it is "well-wooded" it would often be of great
importance that the reader of his report should know
what kind of trees the woods were composed of.</p>

<p class='c005'>For instance, if the wood were of fir or larch trees
it would mean you could get poles for building bridges;
if it were palm trees you know you could get cocoa-nuts
(or dates if they were date palms), and the palm juice
for drinking. Willow trees mean water close by.</p>

<p class='c005'>Or if pine woods or sugar bush or gum-trees it would
mean lots of good fuel. And he must know a poplar
tree by sight, so as not to use poplar wood in camp
if there are any old scouts present&mdash;they have a
superstition that poplar brings bad luck.</p>

<p class='c005'>A scout should, therefore, make a point of learning
the names and appearances of the trees in his country.</p>

<p class='c005'>He should get hold of a leaf of each kind and compare
it with the leaf on the tree.</p>

<p class='c005'>Horse chestnut is not so called because horses like the
chestnuts, but because it has on the bark of its smaller
branches small marks like horse-shoes with all the nails
in them; and then get to know the general shape and
appearance of each kind of tree, so as to be able to
recognise it at a distance, and not only in summer, but
also in winter.</p>

<p class='c005'>There are numbers of berries, nuts, roots, barks, and
leaves that are good to eat.</p>

<p class='c005'>The same with crops of different kinds of corn and

  <h5 class='c012'>PLAY. <br /> THE DIAMOND THIEF.</h5>
</div>
<p class='c004'>(Best performed in the open air and in dumbshow.)</p>

<p class='c005'>A party of prospectors have been out into the wild
country in South Africa, and have found a magnificent
diamond. They are now making their way back to
civilization with it. Horse-sickness has killed off their
horses, and so they are doing the journey on foot,
carrying their blankets, food, and cooking pots.</p>

<p class='c005'>As the heat of the day comes on they camp for the
day, meaning to push on again at night. They rig up
blanket-tents and light fires and cook their food, weave
mattresses, sing songs of home, play cards, etc. The
diamond is taken out of the sardine tin in which it is kept
for all to look at and admire. It is then put carefully
back. The box is placed out in the open where it can
be seen and one man is told off as a sentry to guard it.
The remainder have their food, and then gradually lie
down to sleep. When the camp is all still, the sentry
gets tired of standing and presently sits down and
begins to nod.</p>

<p class='c005'>While he is dozing the diamond thief sneaks into
sight, creeps near to the camp, and crouches, watching
the sleeping man; when the sentry wakes up for a
moment with a start the thief crouches flat.</p>

<p class='c005'>Eventually the sentry reclines and goes to sleep.
Inch by inch the thief creeps up, till he stealthily
removes the sentry's gun (or pistol) out of his reach;
then he swiftly glides up to the diamond-box, seizes it,
and sneaks quickly away, without being discovered,
dodges about, walks backward, and wipes out his tracks
as he goes in order to confuse pursuers.</p>

<p class='c005'>The leader wakes with a yawn, and, when looking
round, starts when he sees there is no sentry standing
about. He springs up, rushes to the sleeping sentry,
shakes him up, and asks him where is the diamond.
Sentry wakes up confused and scared. Remainder
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>wake and crowd angrily together threatening and
questioning the sentry.</p>

<p class='c005'>When one suddenly sees the footprints of the thief he
follows in jerks of a few paces; along the trail the rest
follow and help to pick it up, first one and then another
finding it till they go off the scene. The leader is about
to follow them when he stops, and waves them onward,
and then turns back to the sentry who is standing
stupefied. He hands him a pistol and hints to him that
having ruined his friends by his faithlessness, he may as
well shoot himself. The leader then turns to follow the
rest, looking about for them. A shout is heard in the
distance just as the guilty sentry is putting the pistol to
his head&mdash;the leader stops him from shooting himself.
And both stand listening to shouts in the distance.</p>

<p class='c005'>Remainder of the men return bringing in with them
the thief and the diamond all safe.</p>

<p class='c005'>They then sit round in a semicircle, the leader on a
mound or box in the centre with the diamond in front of
him. The thief standing with arms bound, is tried and
condemned to be shot. He goes away a few paces and
sits down with his back to the rest and thinks over his
past life.</p>

<p class='c005'>They then try the sentry, and condemn him as a
punishment for his carelessness to shoot the thief.</p>

<p class='c005'>All get up. They start to dig a grave. When ready,
the thief is made to stand up, his eyes are bound. The
sentry takes a pistol and shoots him. Remainder then
bring a blanket and lift the dead man into it and carry
him to the grave&mdash;to the opposite side from the audience
so that everyone can see the "body" lowered into the
grave. They then withdraw the blanket, fill in the grave,
and trample the earth down. All shake hands with the
sentry to show that they forgive him.</p>

<p class='c005'>Pack up camp, put out fire, and continue their journey
with the diamond.</p>

<p class='c005'>N.B.&mdash;The grave is managed thus: A hole must be
previously prepared rather near to the edge of the scena.
Then a tunnel must be made by which the "corpse" can
creep out of the grave and get away underground.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>This is done by digging a trench and roofing it with
boards or hurdles and covering it over with earth and
turf again, so that the audience will not notice it. The
grave, too, is made in the same way, but shallower and
partly filled up with sods; the diggers remove the top
earth, then, hidden by the rest crowding round, they
remove the board and pile up the sods on the surface. As
soon as the corpse is lowered into the grave he creeps
away down the tunnel, and so goes off the scene The
diggers throw in some earth, jump down and trample it,
then pile up the sods on top till they make a nice,
looking grave.</p>

<p class='c005'>The whole thing wants careful rehearsing beforehand,
but is most effective when well done, especially if accompanied
by sympathetic music.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is a good thing to use for an open air show to
attract a crowd when raising funds for your troop.</p>

</div>
<h4 class='c012'>CAMP FIRE YARN.&mdash;No. 11. <br /> PIONEERING.</h4>
<p class='c004'>Knot-tying&mdash;Hutmaking&mdash;Felling Trees&mdash;Bridging&mdash;Measurements&mdash;Handicrafts.</p>
<p class='c004'>Pioneers are men who go ahead to open up a way in
the jungles or elsewhere for those coming after them.</p>

<p class='c005'>When I was on service on the West Coast of Africa I
had command of a large force of native scouts, and, like
all scouts, we tried to make ourselves useful in every
way to our main army. So not only did we look out for
the enemy and watch his moves, but we also did what
we could to improve the road for our own army, since it
was merely a narrow track through thick jungle and
swamps. That is, we became pioneers as well as scouts.
In the course of our march, we built nearly two hundred
bridges of timber over streams. But when I first set
the scouts to do this most important work I found that, out
of the thousand men, a great many did not know how to
use an axe to cut down the trees, and, except one company
of about sixty men, none knew how to make knots&mdash;even
bad knots. So they were quite useless for building
bridges, as this had to be done by tying poles
together.</p>

<p class='c005'>So every scout ought to be able to tie knots.</p>

<p class='c005'>To tie a knot seems to be a simple thing, and yet there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>are right ways and wrong ways of doing it, and scouts
ought to know the right way. Very often it may happen
that lives depend on a knot being properly tied.</p>

<p class='c005'>The right kind of knot to tie is one which you can be
certain will hold under any amount of strain, and which
you can always undo easily if you wish to.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>A bad knot, which is called a "granny," is one which
slips away when a hard pull comes on it, or which gets
jammed so tight that you cannot untie it.</p>

<p class='c005'>The following are useful knots which every scout
ought to know, and ought to use whenever he is tying
string or rope, etc.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Rope.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>We had no rope with us in West Africa, so we used
the strong creeping plants, and also used thin withes or
long whippy sticks which we made still more pliant or
bendable by holding one end under foot and twisting
the other round and round with our hands. The best
wood for withes in England is willow or hazel. You
see them used for binding faggots of wood together.
You cannot tie all knots with them as with rope&mdash;but
they can generally make a timber hitch; or this withe
knot.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>HUT BUILDING.</h5>
<p class='c004'>To live comfortably in camp a scout must know how to
make a bivouac shelter for the night, or a hut if he is
going to be for a long time in camp.</p>

<p class='c005'>It all depends on the country and weather as to what
sort of shelter you put up.</p>

<p class='c005'>In making your roof, whether of branches of fir-trees,
or of grass or reeds, etc., put them on as you would do
tiles or slates, beginning at the bottom so that the upper
overlap the lower ones and thus run off the rain without
letting it through.</p>

<p class='c005'>Notice which direction the wind generally blows from
and put the back of your shelter that way with your fire
in front of it.</p>

<p class='c005'>The simplest shelter is to plant two forked sticks
firmly in the ground, and rest a cross bar on them as
ridge-pole. Then lean other poles against it, or a
hurdle or branches, and thatch it with grass, etc.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>Or another good way, and quicker, is to cut one pole
only and lean it against a tree, binding its end there;
then thatch it with branches or brushwood, etc.</p>

<p class='c005'>Where you have no poles available you can do as the
South African natives do&mdash;pile up a lot of brushwood,
heather, etc., into a small wall made in semi-circle to
keep out the cold wind; and make your fire in the open
part.</p>

<p class='c005'>If your tent or hut is too hot in the sun, put blankets
or more straw, etc., over the top. The thicker the roof
the cooler is the tent in summer. If it is too cold, make
the bottom of the walls thicker, or build a small wall of
sods about a foot high round the foot of the wall outside.
Never forget to dig a good drain all round your hut,
so that if heavy rain comes in the night your floor will
not get flooded from outside.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Framework of a Bivouac Shelter, to be thatched with brushwood or grass. A second lean-to roof on opposite side of ridge pole will then make a hut.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Zulus make their huts by planting in the ground a
circle of long whippy sticks standing upright, then they
bend the tops all down towards the centre and tie them
together, then they weave more whippy sticks round in
and out of the uprights horizontally until they have made
a kind of circular bird-cage, this they then cover with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>straw mat or thatch, or with straw woven into the sticks.
Sometimes a small hole is left at the top where all the
sticks join, to act as a chimney.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/fig078.jpg' alt='Hut.' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Hut.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The Red Indians make their "Tee Pee" with several
poles tied together in the form of a pyramid, and over
these they pass a piece of canvas, which at a little
distance looks like a bell tent.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>FELLING TREES.</h5>
<p class='c004'>A scout must know how to use an axe or bill-hook for
chopping down small trees and branches.</p>

<p class='c005'>The way to cut down a tree is first to chop out a
chunk of wood near the bottom of the stem on that side
to which you want the tree to fall, then go round to the
other side, and chop away on the opposite side of the
stem a few inches above the first cut until the tree
topples over. It is a matter of practice to become a
wood-cutter, but you have to be very careful at first lest
in chopping you miss the tree and chop your own leg.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>
  <h5 class='c012'>HOW TO MAKE BRIDGES.</h5>
</div>
<p class='c004'>As I told you before, my scouts in Ashanti, when also
acting as pioneers, had to build nearly two hundred
bridges&mdash;and they had to make them out of any kind of
material that they could find on the spot.</p>

<p class='c005'>There are many ways of making bridges. In the Army
they are generally made of poles lashed together. In
India, in the Himalaya Mountains the natives make
bridges out of three ropes stretched across the river and
connected together every few yards by V-shaped sticks,
so that one rope forms the footpath and the other two
make the handrail on each side. They are jumpy kind
of bridges to walk across, but they take you over; and
they are easily made.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/fig079.jpg' alt='How to Fell a Tree.' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>How to Fell a Tree.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The simplest way for bridging a narrow, deep stream
is to fell a tree, or two trees side by side, on the bank, so
that they fall across the stream. With an adze you then
flatten the topside; put up a hand-rail, and there you
have a very good bridge.</p>

<p class='c005'>Rafts, too, can be used. You build your raft alongside
the bank, in the water if the river is shallow; on the bank
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>if deep. When it is finished you hold on to the down
stream end, push the other out from the bank and let the
stream carry it down into position.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Rope Bridge.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h5 class='c012'>SELF MEASURES.</h5>
<p class='c004'>Every pioneer should know his exact personal
measurement in the following details (of which I give
the average man's measure):</p>

  <h5 class='c012'>THE SCOUT IS ALWAYS A HANDY-MAN.</h5>
</div>
<p class='c004'>Pioneers are always "handy-men." In the Army the
Regimental Pioneers are the men who in war make
bridges and roadways for the troops to get along; they
destroy the enemy's bridges and railways so that he
cannot get away; and they blow up his fortifications so
that the rest of the soldiers can rush in and capture the
place, and so on. In peace-time the pioneers do all the
useful jobs in barracks, such as carpentering, doing
plumbers' and painters' work, bricklaying and metal
work, making chairs, tables, bookshelves, etc. So scouts,
if they want to be handy pioneers, should also learn this
kind of work; and it will always be useful to them
afterwards.</p>

<p class='c005'>Also scouts must know how to mend and even to make
themselves clothes and boots. I have made myself
boots as well as shoes out of all sorts of materials, but
always wished I had, while a boy, learned to do a bit of
boot-mending from a cobbler.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>HINTS TO INSTRUCTORS.</h5>
<p class='c004'><i>Start a carpentry class, or instruction in electricity,
or plumbing, elementary engineering, etc., with a view
to teaching the boys handicrafts that may be of real use
to them in their future life. If you do not know enough
about it yourself, get a friend to come and demonstrate
with models or instruments for a few evenings.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>Get leave to take the scouts over a factory to study
the engines, etc.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>Teach the boys to chop firewood. If they learn to
chop up old packing cases, etc., and make the billets into
bundles for the trade, they can earn a good deal
towards their funds.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>Teach them to make wooden mechanical toys, (from
one or two penny ones as models.) Thereby teaching
them elementary mechanics, and handiness with tools.</i></p>

races between scouts in heats, the losers to pair off

In this way (which should be used in other branches of
instruction also) the worst performers get the most
practice&mdash;and the emulation is just as great to avoid
being the worst, as it would be in striving to be the best,
and win a prize.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Comfort in Camp&mdash;Useful Tricks and Dodges&mdash;Camp
Fires and all about them&mdash;Tidiness.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>COMFORT IN CAMP.</h5>
<p class='c004'>Some people talk of "roughing it" in camp. Those
people are generally "tenderfoots"; an old backwoodsman
doesn't rough it, he knows how to look after himself
and to make himself comfortable by a hundred little
dodges. For instance if there are no tents he doesn't
sit down to shiver and grouse, but at once sets to work to
rig up a shelter or a hut for himself. He chooses a good
spot for it where he is not likely to be flooded out if a
storm of rain were to come on. Then he lights up a
camp fire and makes himself a comfortable mattress of
ferns or straw. An old scout is full of resource, that is
he can find a way out of any difficulty or discomfort. He
is full of "dodges," like the boy who had to rap on the
door with the knocker which he could not reach. He
showed resourcefulness.</p>

<p class='c005'>A bivouac is a halt without tents and generally is not
meant to last for many hours; a camp generally means a
resting place with tents or huts to live in.</p>

<p class='c005'>There are many ways of making a comfortable bed in
camp, but always if possible have some kind of covering
over the ground between your body and the earth,
especially after wet weather. Cut grass or straw or
bracken are very good things to lay down thickly where
you are going to lie, but if you cannot get any of these
and are obliged to lie on the ground, do not forget before
lying down to make a small hole about the size of a tea-cup
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>in which your hip joint will rest when you are lying
on your side; it makes all the difference for sleeping
comfortably. A very comfortable bed, almost a spring
mattress, is made in Canada by cutting a large number
of tops of the fir-tree branches and planting them upright
in the ground as close together as possible, like bristles
in a brush, so close that when you lie down on them they
form a comfortable and springy couch.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Resourcefulness in Doing a Good Turn.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Remember when sleeping in camp the secret of
keeping warm is to have as many blankets <i>underneath</i>
you as you have above you. If a patrol were sleeping
round a fire you would all lie with your feet towards it
like the spokes of a wheel. If your blankets do not
keep you sufficiently warm, put straw or bracken over
yourselves and newspapers if you have them. It is also
a good tip in cold weather, if you have not sufficiently
warm clothing, to put a newspaper under your coat or
waistcoat up your back and round your body, it will be
as good as a great-coat in giving you extra warmth.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>To make a bed, cut four poles&mdash;two of seven feet, two
of three&mdash;lay them on the ground so as to form the
edges.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id008'>
<img src='images/fig082.jpg' alt='Bed.' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Bed.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Cut four pegs, two feet long, and sharpen, drive them
into the ground at the four corners to keep the poles in
place.</p>

<p class='c005'>Cut down a fir tree; cut off all branches and lay them
overlapping each other like slates on a roof till a thick
bed of them is made; the outside ones underlapping the
poles. Cover with a blanket.</p>

<p class='c005'>To make a mattress you first set up a camp loom (see
"Hints to Instructors," page 163) and weave a mattress
out of bracken, ferns, heather, straw, or grass, etc., six
feet long and two feet nine inches across.</p>

<p class='c005'>With this same loom you can make grass or straw
mats, with which to form tents, or shelters, or walls, or
carpets, etc.</p>

<p class='c005'>Camp candlesticks can be made by bending a bit of
wire into a small spiral spring; or by using a cleft stick
stuck in the wall; or a glass candle shade can be made
by cutting the bottom off a bottle and sticking it upside
down in the ground with a candle stuck into the neck.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/fig083.jpg' alt='Camp Candlesticks.' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Camp Candlesticks.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The bottom of the bottle may be cut off either by putting
about an inch or an inch and a half of water into the
bottle and then standing it in the embers of the fire till
it gets hot and cracks at the water-level. Or it can be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>done by passing a piece of string round the body of the
bottle, and drawing it rapidly to and fro till it makes a
hot line round the bottle which then breaks neatly off
with a blow or on being immersed in cold water.</p>

<p class='c005'>Camp forks can also be made out of wire sharpened at
the points.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is something to know how to sit down in a wet
camp. You "squat" instead of sitting. Natives in
India squat on their heels, but this is a tiring way if you
have not done it as a child; though it comes easy if you
put a sloping stone or chock of wood under your heels.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>Boers and other camp men squat on one heel. It is a
little tiring at first.</p>

<p class='c005'>Buttons are always being lost in camp, and it adds
greatly to your comfort to know how to make buttons
out of bootlaces or string. This will be shown to you.
Scouts should also be able to carve collar studs out of
wood, bone, or horn.</p>

<p class='c005'>A great secret of sleeping comfortably in camp
is to have a canvas bag about two feet long by one foot
wide into which you pack odds and ends&mdash;or carry
empty and fill up with grass or underclothing to form
your pillow at night.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>CAMP FIRES.&mdash;THE RIGHT WAY OF MAKING THEM.</h5>
<p class='c004'>Before lighting your fire remember always to do as
every backwoodsman does, and that is to cut away or
burn all bracken, heather, grass, etc., round the fire to
prevent its setting light to the surrounding grass or bush.
Many bad bush-fires have been caused by young tenderfoots
fooling about with blazes which they imagined to
be camp fires. In burning the grass for this purpose,
(or "ring-burning" as it is called) burn only a little at a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>time and have branches of trees or old sacks ready with
which you can beat it out again at once when it has
gone far enough.</p>

<p class='c005'>Scouts should always be on the look-out to beat out a
bush-fire that has been accidentally started at any time
as a "good turn" to the owner of the land or to people
who may have herds and crops in danger.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is no use to learn how to light a fire by hearsay, the
only way is to pay attention to the instructions given
you, and then practise laying and lighting a fire yourself.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the book called "Two Little Savages," instructions
for laying a fire are given in the following rhyme:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>First a curl of birch bark as dry as it can be,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then some twigs of soft wood dead from off a tree,</div>
      <div class='line'>Last of all some pine knots to make a kettle foam,</div>
      <div class='line'>And there's a fire to make you think you're sitting right at home.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/fig085.jpg' alt='Star Fire Ready to Light.' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Star Fire Ready to Light.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Remember to begin your fire with a small amount of
very small chips or twigs of really dry dead wood lightly
heaped together and a little straw or paper to ignite it;
about this should be put little sticks leaning together in
the shape of a pyramid, and above this bigger sticks
similarly standing on end. When the fire is well alight
bigger sticks can be added, and, finally, logs of wood.
A great thing for a cooking fire is to get a good pile of
red hot wood ashes, and if you use three large logs they
should be placed lying on the ground, star-shaped, like
the spokes of a wheel, with their ends centred in the
fire. A fire made in this way need never go out, for as
the logs burn away you keep pushing them towards the
centre of the fire, always making fresh red hot ashes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>there. This makes a good cooking fire, and also one
which gives very little flame or smoke for the enemy to
detect from a distance.</p>

<p class='c005'>To leave your fire alight at night, cover it over with a
heap of ashes and it will smoulder all night ready for
early use in the morning, when you can easily blow it
into a glow.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/fig086.jpg' alt='Camp Grate.' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Camp Grate.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>If you want to keep a fire going all night to show or
to warm you, put good-sized logs end to end star shaped&mdash;and
one long one reaching to your hand so that you
can push it in from time to time to the centre without
trouble of getting up to stoke the fire.</p>

<p class='c005'>If coals or wood are difficult to get for making fires at
home, don't forget that old boots which you often find
lying about on dustheaps, make very good fuel.</p>

<p class='c005'>You can do a good turn to any poor old woman in
winter time by collecting old boots and giving them to
her for firing.</p>

<p class='c005'>Another way to make a good cooking fire is one they
use in America.</p>

<p class='c005'>Drive two stout stakes into the ground about four feet
apart, both leaning a bit backwards. Cut down a young
tree with a trunk some fifteen feet high and ten inches
thick; chop it into five-foot lengths; lay three logs, one
on top of another, leaning against the upright stakes.
This forms the back of your fireplace. Two short logs are
then laid as fire-dogs, and a log laid across them as front
bar of the fire. Inside this "grate" you build a pyramid-shaped
fire, which then gives out great heat. The
"grate" must, of course, be built so that it faces the wind.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>Tongs are useful about a camp-fire, and can be made
from a rod of beech or other tough wood, about four feet
long and one inch thick. Shave it away in the middle
to about half its proper thickness, and put this part into
the hot embers of the fire for a few moments, and bend
the stick over till the two ends come together. Then
flatten away the inside edges of the ends so that they
have a better grip&mdash;and there are your tongs.</p>

<p class='c005'>A besom is also useful for keeping the camp clean,
and can easily be made with a few sprigs of birch bound
tightly round a stake.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Drying Clothes.</span>&mdash;You will often get wet through on
service, and you will see recruits remaining in their wet
clothes until they get dry again; no old scout would do
so, as that is the way to catch fever and get ill. When
you are wet, take the first opportunity of getting your
wet clothes off and drying them, even though you may
not have other clothes to put on, as happened to me
many a time. I have sat naked under a waggon while
my one suit of clothes was drying over a fire. The way
to dry clothes over a fire is to make a fire of hot ashes,
and then build a small beehive-shaped cage of sticks
over the fire, and then to hang your clothes all over this
cage, and they will very quickly dry. Also, in hot
weather it is dangerous to sit in your clothes when they
have got wet from your perspiration. On the West
Coast of Africa I always carried a spare shirt, hanging
down my back, with the sleeves tied round my neck; so
soon as I halted I would take off the wet shirt I was
wearing and put on the dry, which had been hanging
out in the sun on my back. By these means I never got
fever when almost everyone else went down with it.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>TIDINESS.</h5>
<p class='c004'>The camp ground should at all times be kept clean
and tidy, not only (as I have pointed out) to keep
flies away, but also because if you go away to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>another place, and leave an untidy ground behind you,
it gives so much important information to enemy's scouts.
For this reason scouts are always tidy, whether in camp
or not, as a matter of habit. If you are not tidy at home
you won't be tidy in camp; and if you're not tidy in camp
you will be only a tenderfoot and no scout.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Right Shoe laced in the Scout's Way.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>[<i>One end of the lace is knotted under the lowest outside hole, and
the lace is brought through and threaded downwards through the
opposite hole; it is then taken up to the top. The dotted part of the
lace is the part which lies underneath the shoe and is not visible.</i>]</p>

<p class='c005'>A scout is tidy also in his tent or room, because he
may yet be suddenly called upon to go off on an alarm,
or something unexpected: and if he does not know
exactly where to lay his hand on his things he will be a
long time in turning out, especially if called up in the
middle of the night. So on going to bed, even when at
home, practise the habit of folding up your clothes and
putting them where you can at once find them in the
dark and get into them quietly.</p>

<p class='c005'>A scout even ties his shoe laces neatly&mdash;in fact
they are not tied, but are wove through the eyelet holes
from top of the boot downwards, and so need no tying.</p>

<h5 class='c012'><i>CAMP ORDERS.</i></h5>
<p class='c004'><i>In going into camp it is essential to have a few
"Standing Orders" published, which can be added to
from time to time if necessary. These should be carefully
explained to patrol leaders, who should then be
held fully responsible that their scouts carry them out
exactly.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>Such orders might point out that each patrol will
camp separately from the others, and there will be a
comparison between the respective cleanliness and good
order of tents and surrounding ground.</i></p>

next cord as it stands at the stakes. This beam is then
moved up and down at slow intervals by one scout, while

Cattle&mdash;Cleanliness&mdash;Water.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>COOKING.</h5>
<p class='c004'>Every scout must, of course, know how to cook his
own meat and vegetables and to make bread for himself
without regular cooking utensils. For boiling water a scout
would usually have his tin "billy," and in that he can boil
vegetables or stew his meat, and often he will want it
for drinking and will cook his meat in some other way.
This would usually be done by sticking it on sharp sticks
and hanging it close to the fire so that it gets broiled;
or the lid of an old biscuit tin can be used as a kind of
frying-pan. Put grease or water in it to prevent the
meat getting burnt before it is cooked.</p>

<p class='c005'>Meat can also be wrapped in a few sheets of wet
paper or in a coating of clay and put in the red-hot
embers of the fire, where it will cook itself. Birds and
fish can also be cooked in this manner, and there is no
need to pluck the bird before doing so if you use clay,
as the feathers will stick to the clay when it hardens in
the heat, and when you break it open the bird will come
out cooked, without its feathers, like the kernel out of a
nutshell.</p>

<p class='c005'>Another way is to clean out the inside of the bird, get
a pebble about the size of its inside, and heat it till nearly
red-hot, place it inside the bird, and put the bird on a
gridiron or on a wooden spit over the fire.</p>

<p class='c005'>Birds are most easily plucked immediately after being
killed.</p>

<p class='c005'>Don't do as I did once when I was a tenderfoot. It
was my turn to cook, so I thought I would vary the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>dinner by giving them soup. I had some pea-flour, and
I mixed it with water and boiled it up, and served it as
pea-soup; but I did not put in any stock or meat juice
of any kind. I didn't know that it was necessary or
would be noticeable. But they noticed it directly&mdash;called
my beautiful soup a "wet peas-pudding," and told
me I might eat it myself&mdash;not only told me I <i>might</i>, but
they jolly well <i>made</i> me eat it. I never made the mistake

stand it on the logs (where it often falls over unless care
is taken), or, better, stand it on the ground among the hot
embers of the fire, or else rig up a triangle of three green
poles over the fire, tying them together at the top and
hanging the pot by a wire or chain from the poles. But
in making this tripod do not, if there is an old scout in
camp, use poplar sticks for poles, because, although they
are easy to cut and trim for the purpose, old-fashioned
scouts have a fancy that they bring bad luck to the
cooking. Any other kind of wood will do better.</p>

<p class='c005'>This is as good a kind of camp kitchen as any, it is
made with two lines of sods, bricks, stones, or thick logs,
flattened at the top, about six feet long, slightly splayed
from each other, being four inches apart at one end and
eight inches at the other&mdash;the big end towards the
wind.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>Another way, when there are several "billies" to cook,
is to put them in two lines a few inches apart, one end of
the line facing towards the wind. Lay your fire of small
wood between the two lines, and put a third row of
"billies" standing on top of the first two rows&mdash;so that
a small tunnel is made by the "billies." In the windward
end of this tunnel start your fire; the draught will carry
its heat along the tunnel, and this will heat all the pots.
The fire should be kept up with small split chunks of
wood.</p>

<p class='c005'>When boiling a pot of water on the fire, do not jam
the lid on too firmly, as when the steam forms inside the
pot it must have some means of escape or it will burst
the pot.</p>

<p class='c005'>To find out when the water is beginning to boil, you
need not take off the lid and look, but just hold the end
of a stick, or knife, etc., to the pot, and if the water is
boiling you will feel it trembling.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>Kabobs.</i>&mdash;Cut your meat up into a slice about half or
three-quarters of an inch thick; cut this up into small
pieces about one to one and a half inches across. String
a lot of these chunks on to a stick or iron rod, and plant it
in front of the fire, or suspend it over the hot embers for
a few minutes till the meat is roasted.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>Hunter's Stew.</i>&mdash;Chop your meat into small chunks
about an inch or one and a half inches square.</p>

<p class='c005'>Scrape and chop up any vegetables, such as potatoes,
carrots, onions, etc., and put them into your "billy."</p>

<p class='c005'>Add clean water or soup till it is half full.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mix some flour, salt, and pepper together, and rub
your meat well in it, and put this in the "billy."</p>

<p class='c005'>There should be enough water just to cover the food&mdash;no
more.</p>

<p class='c005'>Let the "billy" stand in the embers and simmer for
about one hour and a quarter.</p>

<p class='c005'>The potatoes take longest to cook. When these are
soft (which you try with a fork) enough not to lift out,
the whole stew is cooked.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>
  <h5 class='c012'>BREAD MAKING.</h5>
</div>
<p class='c004'>To make bread, the usual way is for a scout to take
off his coat, spread it on the ground, with the inside
uppermost (so that any mess he makes in it will not
show outwardly when he wears his coat afterwards);
then he makes a pile of flour on the coat and scoops out
the centre until it forms a cup for the water which he
then pours in hot; he then mixes the dough with a pinch
or two of salt, and of baking-powder or of Eno's Fruit
Salt, and kneads and mixes it well together until it
forms a lump of well-mixed dough. Then with a little
fresh flour sprinkled over the hands to prevent the
dough sticking to them, he pats it and makes it into the
shape of a large bun or several buns.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then he puts it on a gridiron over hot ashes, or
sweeps part of the fire to one side, and on the hot
ground left there he puts his dough, and piles hot ashes
round it and lets it bake itself.</p>

<p class='c005'>Only small loaves like buns can be made in this way.</p>

<p class='c005'>If real bread is required, a kind of oven has to be
made, either by using an old earthenware pot or tin box,
and putting it into the fire and piling fire all over it, or
by making a clay oven, lighting a fire inside it, and then
when it is well heated raking out the fire and putting the
dough inside, and shutting up the entrance tightly till
the bread is baked.</p>

<p class='c005'>Another way is to cut a stout club, sharpen its thin
end, peel it and heat it in the fire. Make a long strip of
dough, about two inches wide and half an inch thick:
wind it spirally down the club; then plant the club close
to the fire and let the dough toast itself, just giving the
club a turn now and then.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>Ration Bags.</i>&mdash;Very often on service they serve you
out with a double handful of flour instead of bread or
biscuits, a bit of meat, a spoonful of salt, one of pepper,
one of sugar, one of baking-powder, and a handful of
coffee or tea. It is rather fun to watch a tenderfoot get
this ration and see how he carries it away to his bivouac.</p>

<p class='c005'>How would you do it?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>Of course you could put the pepper into one pocket,
the salt into another, the sugar into another, the flour
into your hat, and carry that in one hand, the bit of beef
in the other hand, and the coffee in the other.</p>

<p class='c005'>Only if you are in your shirt sleeves, as you generally
are, you haven't many pockets, and if, like some people,
you have only two hands, it is a difficult job.</p>

<p class='c005'>The old campaigner, therefore, always has his three
"ration bags," little bags which he makes himself out of
bits of shirt tails or pocket-handkerchiefs, or other such
luxuries; and into one he puts the flour and baking-powder,
into No. 2 his coffee and sugar, into No. 3 his
salt and pepper.</p>

<p class='c005'>Very often just after we had got our rations we would
have to march at once. How do you suppose we made
our flour into bread in one minute?</p>

<p class='c005'>We just mixed it with a lot of water in a mug and drank
it! It did just as well in the end.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>CATTLE-DRIVING AND SLAUGHTERING.</h5>
<p class='c004'>Before you cook your hare you've got to catch him. So
with mutton or beef&mdash;you have to bring the sheep
or ox to the place where you want him. Then you have
to kill him and cut him up before you can cook him and
eat him.</p>

<p class='c005'>Scouts ought to know how to drive sheep and cattle
and horses. Tenderfoots always forget to send someone
in front of the herd to draw them on.</p>

<p class='c005'>Sheep are apt to crowd up too much together so that
those in the middle of the flock soon get half suffocated
in dust and heat, and then they faint. It is often therefore,
advisable for one driver to keep moving in the
centre of the flock to make an occasional opening for
air, and it keeps the whole flock moving better. If you
come to an obstacle like a stile or wall with sheep, lift
one or two over it and the rest will soon follow, but they
should not be too hurried.</p>

<p class='c005'>Scouts should also know how to kill and cut up their
cattle.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>Cattle are generally poleaxed, or a spike is driven into
the forehead with a mallet, or a shot or blank cartridge
is fired into the forehead, or a big sharp knife is driven
into the spine just behind the horns, the animal's head having
first been securely tied down to a cart wheel or fence.</p>

<p class='c005'>Sheep are generally killed either by being laid on
their side and having their head drawn back and throat
cut with a big sharp knife, or by being shot in the forehead
with a revolver or blank cartridge of a rifle.</p>

<p class='c005'>The animal should then be gutted by having the belly
slit open and the inside taken out, liver and kidneys
being kept.</p>

<p class='c005'>To skin the beast, lay the carcase on its back and slit
the skin down the centre with a sharp knife, slit up the
inside of the legs, and pull the skin off, helping it with
the knife where it sticks to the body, first one side and
then the other down to the back bone.</p>

<p class='c005'>The carcase is split in half in the case of a big
beast; with a sheep it is cut into two, and the fore
quarters and hind quarters are then again divided into
joints.</p>

<p class='c005'>A scout should know how to milk a cow or a goat, else
he may go thirsty when there is lots of milk available.
A goat is not so easy to milk as you might think. You
have to keep hold of its head with one hand, its hind leg
with the other, and milk it with the other if you had a
third. The way a native does it is to catch hold of its hind
leg between his big toe and the next, and thus he has a
hand to spare to milk with.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>CLEANLINESS.</h5>
<p class='c004'>One thing to remember in camp is that if you get
sick you are no use as a scout, and are only a burden to
others, and you generally get ill through your own fault.
Either you don't change into dry clothes when you get wet,
or you let dirt get into your food, or you drink bad water.</p>

<p class='c005'>So, when cooking your food, always be careful to clean
your cooking pots, plates, forks, etc., very thoroughly.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>Flies are most dangerous, because they carry about
seeds of disease on their feet, and if they settle on your
food they will often leave the poison there for you to eat&mdash;and
then you wonder why you get ill. Flies generally
live best where there is dirt, and scraps of food are left
lying about.</p>

<p class='c005'>For this reason you should be careful to keep your
camp very clean, so that flies won't come there. All
slops and scraps should be thrown away into a properly-dug
hole, where they can be buried, and not scattered
about all over the place. Patrol leaders must be very
careful to see that this is always done.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>WATER.</h5>
<p class='c004'>Good drinking water is one of the most important of
all things in campaigning, in order to make sure of your
being healthy.</p>

<p class='c005'>All water has a large number of tiny animals floating
about in it, too small to be seen without the help of a microscope.
Some of them are poisonous, some are not; you
can't tell whether the poisonous ones are there, so the
safest way is to kill them all before you drink any water;
and the way to kill them is to boil the water, and let it
cool again before drinking it. In boiling the water don't
let it merely come to a boil and then take it off, but let
it boil fully for a quarter of an hour, as these little beasts,
or microbes as they are called, are very tough customers,
and take a lot of boiling before they get killed.</p>

<p class='c005'>For the same reason it is very dangerous to drink out
of streams, and especially out of ponds, when you feel
thirsty, for you may suck down any amount of poison in
doing so. If a pond is your only water-supply, it is best
to dig a small well, three feet deep, about ten feet away
from the pond, and the water will ooze through into it,
and will be much more healthy to drink.</p>

<p class='c005'>We did this in Mafeking, when the Boers cut off our
regular water-supply, and so had no sickness from bad
water.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>
  <h5 class='c012'>HINTS TO INSTRUCTORS.</h5>
</div>
<p class='c004'><i>Practise in mixing dough and baking; it is useful. If
possible, get a baker to give a lesson. But let each
scout mix his own dough with the amount of water he
thinks right. Let him make his mistakes at first to get
experience.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>A visit to a slaughter-house and butcher's shop to
see the cutting up is useful for boys.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>Get scouts to make their own linen ration bags.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>Issue raw rations, and let each scout make his own
fire and cook his own meal.</i></p>
<h5 class='c012'>CAMP GAMES.</h5>
<p class='c004'>Hockey, Rounders, Football, Basket Ball, which is
practically football played only with the hands, with a
basket seven feet above ground as goal. A small bit of
ground or a room or court will do for the game.</p>

<p class='c005'>"Bang the Bear" (from Mr. Seton Thompson's
"Birchbark of the Woodcraft Indians.") One big boy is
bear, and has three bases, in which he can take refuge
and be safe. He carries a small air balloon on his back.
The other boys are armed with clubs of straw rope
twisted, with which they try to burst his balloon while
he is outside the base. The bear has a similar club,
with which he knocks off the hunters' hats. The hat
represents the hunter's life. A good game for introducing
strange or shy boys to each other.</p>

<p class='c005'>Songs, recitations, small plays, etc., can be performed
round the camp fire, and every scout should be made to
contribute something to the programme, whether he thinks
he is a performer or not. A different patrol may be told
off for each night of the week to provide for the performance;
they can thus prepare it beforehand.</p>

<p class='c006'>Outdoor Training&mdash;Exploration&mdash;Boat Cruising&mdash;Watermanship&mdash;Mountaineering&mdash;Patrolling&mdash;Nightwork&mdash;Weather
Wisdom.</p>
<p class='c004'>The native boys of the Zulu and Swazi tribes learn to
be scouts before they are allowed to be considered men,
and they do it in this way: when a boy is about fifteen
or sixteen he is taken by the men of his village, stripped
of all clothes and painted white from head to foot, and
he is given a shield and one assegai or small spear, and
he is turned out of the village and told that he will be
killed if anyone catches him while he is still painted
white. So the boy has to go off into the jungle and
mountains and hide himself from other men until the
white paint wears off, and this generally takes about a
month; so that all this time he has to look after himself
and stalk game with his one assegai and kill it and cut it
up; he has to light his fire by means of rubbing sticks
together in order to cook his meat; he has to make the
skin of the animal into a covering for himself; and he
has to know what kind of wild root, berries, and leaves
are good for food as vegetables. If he is not able to do
these things, he dies of starvation, or is killed by wild
animals. If he succeeds in keeping himself alive, and is
able to find his way back to his village, he returns when
the white paint has worn off and is then received with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>great rejoicings by his friends and relations, and is
allowed to become a soldier of the tribe since he has
shown that he is able to look after himself.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is a pity that all British boys cannot have the same
sort of training before they are allowed to consider
themselves men&mdash;and the training which we are now
doing as scouts is intended to fill that want as far as
possible. If every boy works hard at this course and
really learns all that we try to teach him, he will, at the
end of it, have some claim to call himself a scout and a
man, and will find if ever he goes on service, or to a
colony, that he will have no difficulty in looking after
himself and in being really useful to his country.</p>

<p class='c005'>There is an old Canadian scout and trapper, now over
eighty years of age, still living, and, what is more, still
working at his trade of trapping. His name is Bill
Hamilton. In a book which he lately wrote, called "My
Sixty Years in the Plains," he describes the dangers of
that adventurous line of life. The chief danger was that
of falling into the hands of the Red Indians. "To be
taken prisoner was to experience a death not at all to
be desired. A slow fire is merciful beside other cruelties
practised by the Indians. I have often been asked why
we exposed ourselves to such danger? My answer has
always been that there was a charm in the open-air life
of a scout from which one cannot free himself after he
has once come under its spell. Give me the man who
has been raised among the great things of Nature; he
cultivates truth, independence, and self-reliance; he has
generous impulses; he is true to his friends, and true to
the flag of his country."</p>

<p class='c005'>I can fully endorse what this old scout has said, and,
what is more, I find that those men who come from the
furthest frontiers of the Empire, from what we should
call a rude and savage life, are among the most
generous and chivalrous of their race, especially towards
women and weaker folk. They become "gentle men" by
their contact with nature.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Roosevelt, the President of the United States of
America, also is one who believes in outdoor life, and he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>indulges in it himself on every possible occasion when
his duties allow. He writes:</p>

<p class='c005'>"I believe in outdoor games, and I do not mind in the
least that they are rough games, or that those who take
part in them are occasionally injured. I have no
sympathy with the overwrought sentiment which would
keep a young man in cotton wool. The out-of-doors man
must always prove the better in life's contest. When
you play, play hard; and when you work, work hard.
But do not let your play and your sport interfere with
your study."</p>

<p class='c005'>I knew an old Boer who after the war said that he
could not live in the country with the British, so he went
off to take service with the German troops which were at
that time fighting in the neighbouring district of South
West Africa. But after some months he came back and
said that after all he preferred to be with the British.</p>

<p class='c005'>He said that one of his reasons for disliking the
British was that when they arrived in the country they
were so 'stom' as he called it&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> so utterly stupid when
living on the veldt that they did not know how to look
after themselves, to make themselves comfortable in
camp, to kill their food or to cook it, and they were
always losing their way on the veldt; he allowed that after
six months or so the English soldiers got to learn how to
manage for themselves fairly well. But when he went
to the Germans he found that they were even more
'stom' than the British, with the great difference that
they went on being 'stom,' no matter how long they
remained in the country. He said they were 'stom' till
they died, and they generally died through blundering
about at the business end of a mule.</p>

<p class='c005'>The truth is that, being brought up in a civilised
country like England, soldiers and others have no
training whatever in looking after themselves out on the
veldt, or in the backwoods, and the consequence is that
when they go out to a colony or on a campaign they are
for a long time perfectly helpless and go through a lot of
hardship and trouble which would not occur had they
learnt, while boys, how to look after themselves both in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>camp and when on patrol. They are just a lot of
"Tenderfoots."</p>

<p class='c005'>They have never had to light a fire, or to cook their
own food; that has always been done for them. At
home, if they wanted water they merely had to turn on
the tap, and had no idea of how to set about finding
water in a desert place by looking at the grass, or bush,
or by scratching at the sand till they began to find signs
of dampness; and if they lost their way, or did not know
the time, they merely had to "ask a policeman." They
had always found houses to shelter them, and beds to lie
in. They had never to manufacture these for themselves,
nor to make their own boots or clothing. That is why a
"tenderfoot" talks of "roughing in camp"; but living in
camp for a scout who knows the game is by no means
"roughing it." He knows how to make himself
comfortable in a thousand small ways, and then when he
does come back to civilisation, he enjoys it all the more
for having seen a contrast; and even there he can do
very much more for himself than the ordinary mortal
who has never really learned to provide for his own
wants. The man who has had to turn his hand to many
things, as the scout does in camp, finds that when he
comes into civilisation he is more easily able to obtain
employment, because he is ready to turn his hand to
whatever kind of work may turn up.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>EXPLORATION.</h5>
<p class='c004'>A good form of scout work can be got in Great Britain
by scouts going about either as patrols on an exploring
expedition, or in pairs like knight-errants of old on a
pilgrimage through the country to find people wanting
help and to help them. This can equally well be done
with bicycles, or, in the winter, by skating along the
canals.</p>

<p class='c005'>Scouts in carrying out such a tramp should never, if
possible, sleep under a roof&mdash;that is to say, on fine nights
they would sleep in the open wherever they may be, or, in
bad weather, would get leave to occupy a hay loft or barn.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>You should on all occasions take a map with you, and
find your way by it, as far as possible, without having to
ask the way of passers-by. You would, of course, have
to do your daily good turn whenever opportunity presented
itself, but besides that, you should do good turns
to farmers and others who may allow you the use of their
barns, and so on, as a return for their kindness.</p>

<p class='c005'>As a rule, you should have some object in your
expedition, that is to say, if you are a patrol of town
boys, you would go off with the idea of scouting some
special spot, say a mountain in Scotland or Wales, or a
lake in Cumberland, or, possibly, some old castle, or
battle-field, or a sea-side beach. Or you may be on your
way to join one of the larger camps.</p>

<p class='c005'>If, on the other hand, you are a patrol from the
country, you can make your way up to London, or to a
big town, with the idea of going to see its buildings, and
its Zoological Gardens, circuses, museums, etc. And
you should notice everything as you go along the roads,
and remember, as far as possible, all your journey, so
that you could give directions to anybody else who
wanted to follow that road afterwards. And make a
map. Explorers, of course, keep a log or journal giving
a short account of each day's journey, with sketches or
photos of any interesting things they see.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>BOAT CRUISING.</h5>
<p class='c004'>Instead of tramping or cycling, it is also an excellent
practice for a patrol to take a boat and make a trip in
that way through the country; but none should be
allowed in the boat who is not a good swimmer, because
accidents are pretty sure to happen, and if all are
swimmers, it does not matter; in fact, it is rather a
good experience than otherwise.</p>

<p class='c005'>I once made such a cruise with two of my brothers.
We took a small folding-up canvas boat, and went as far
up the Thames as we could possibly get till it became
so narrow and small a stream that we were continually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>having to get out and pull our boat over fallen trees and
stopped up bits of river. Then we took it on the Avon,
which rises near the source of the Thames, but flows to
the westward, and here, again, we began where the river
was very small, and gradually worked our way down
until it developed into a big stream, and so through
Bath and Bristol on to the Severn. Then across the
Severn, and up the Wye into Wales. We carried with
us our tent, stores, and cooking apparatus, so that we
were able to live out independent of houses the whole
time. A more enjoyable trip could not be imagined,
and the expense was very small.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>WATERMANSHIP.</h5>
<p class='c004'>It is very necessary for a scout to be able to swim, for
he never knows when he may have to cross a river, to
swim for his life, or to plunge in to save someone from
drowning, so those of you that cannot swim should make
it your business to begin at once and learn; it is not
very difficult.</p>

<p class='c005'>Also, a scout should be able to manage a boat, to bring
it properly alongside the ship or pier, that is, either by
rowing it or steering it in a wide circle so that it comes
up alongside with its head pointing the same way as the
bow of the ship or towards the current. You should be
able to row one oar in time with the rest of the boat's
crew, or to scull a pair of oars, or to scull a boat by screwing
a single oar over the stern. In rowing, the object of
feathering or turning the blade of the oar flat when it is
out of the water, is to save it from catching the wind and
thereby checking the pace of the boat. You should
know how to throw a coil of rope so as to fling it on to
another boat or wharf, or how to catch and make fast a
rope thrown to you. Also you should know how to
make a raft out of any materials that you can get hold of,
such as planks, logs, barrels, sacks of straw, and so on,
for often you may want to cross a river with your food and
baggage where no boats are available, or you may be in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>shipwreck where nobody can make a raft for saving
themselves. You should also know how to throw a lifebuoy
to a drowning man. These things can only be learnt
by practice.</p>

<p class='c005'>As a scout you must know how to fish, else you would
find yourself very helpless, and perhaps starving, on a
river which is full of food for you if you were only able
to catch it.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>MOUNTAINEERING.</h5>
<p class='c004'>A good deal of interesting mountaineering can be done in
the British Isles if you know where to go; and it is
grand sport, and brings out into practice all your scout-craft
to enable you to find your way, and to make
yourself comfortable in camp.</p>

<p class='c005'>You are, of course, continually losing your direction
because, moving up and down in the deep gullies of the
mountain side, you lose sight of the landmarks which
usually guide you, so that you have to watch your
direction by the sun, and by your compass, and keep on
estimating in what direction your proper line of travel
lies.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then, again, you are very liable to be caught in fogs
and mists, which are at all times upsetting to the
calculations even of men who know every inch of the
country. I had such an experience in Scotland last year
when, in company with a Highlander who knew the
ground, we got lost in the mist. But supposing that he
knew the way, I committed myself entirely to his
guidance, and after going some distance I felt bound to
remark to him that I noticed the wind had suddenly
changed, for it had been blowing from our left when we
started, and was now blowing hard on our right cheek.
However, he seemed in no way nonplussed, and led on.
Presently I remarked that the wind was blowing behind us,
so that either the wind, or the mountain, or we ourselves
were turning round; and eventually it proved as I
suggested, that it was not the wind that had turned, or
the mountain, it was ourselves who had wandered round
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>in a complete circle, and were almost back at the point
we started from within an hour.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then scouts working on a mountain ought to practise
the art of roping themselves together, as mountaineers
do on icy slopes to save themselves from falling into
holes in the snow and slipping down precipices. When
roped together in this way supposing that one man falls,
the weight of the others will save him from going down
into the depths.</p>

<p class='c005'>When roped together each man has about 14ft. between
himself and the next man. The rope is fastened round
his waist by a loop or bowline, the knot being on his left
side. Each man has to keep back off the man in front
of him so as to keep the rope tight all the time; then if
one falls or slips the others lean away from him with all
their weight and hold him up till he regains his footing.
A loop takes up about 4ft. 6in. of rope and should be a
"bowline" at the ends of the rope, and an "overhead
knot" or a "middleman's loop" for central men on the
rope.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>PATROLLING.</h5>
<p class='c004'>Scouts generally go about scouting in pairs, or sometimes
singly; if more go together they are called a patrol.
When they are patrolling the scouts of a patrol hardly
ever move close together, they are spread out so as to
see more country and so that if cut off or ambuscaded
by an enemy they will not all get caught, some will get
away to give information. A patrol of six scouts working
in open country would usually move in this sort of formation:
in the shape of a kite with the patrol leader in the
centre, if going along a street or road the patrol would
move in a similar way, but in this formation keep close to
the hedges or walls. No. 2 scout is in front, Nos. 3 and
4 to the right and left, No. 5 to the rear, and No. 6 with
the leader (No. 1) in the centre.</p>

<p class='c005'>Patrols when going across open country where they
are likely to be seen by enemies or animals should get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>over it as quickly as possible, <i>i.e.</i>, by moving at the
scout's pace, walking and running alternately from one
point of cover to another. As soon as they are hidden
in cover they can rest and look round before making the
next move. If as leading scout you get out of sight of
your patrol, you should, in passing thick bushes, reeds,
etc., break branches or stems of reed and grass every
few yards, making the heads point <i>forward</i> to show your
path, for in this way you can always find your way back
again, or the patrol or anyone coming after you can
easily follow you up and they can judge from the
freshness of the grass pretty well how long ago it was
you passed that way. It is also useful to "blaze" trees&mdash;that
means take a chip out of the bark with your axe or
knife, or chalk marks upon walls, or make marks in the
sand, or lay stones, or show which way you have gone
by the signs which I have given you.</p>

<p>Patrol in the Open, or on a Road or Street.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h5 class='c012'>NIGHT WORK.</h5>
<p class='c004'>Scouts must be able to find their way equally well by
night as by day. In fact, military scouts in the Army
work mostly by night in order to keep hidden, and lie
up during the day.</p>

<p class='c005'>But unless they practise it frequently, fellows are very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>apt to lose themselves by night, distances seem greater,
and landmarks are hard to see. Also, you are apt to make
more noise than by day, in walking along, by accidently
treading on dry sticks, kicking stones, etc.</p>

<p class='c005'>If you are watching for an enemy at night you have to
trust much more to your ears than to your eyes, and
also to your nose, for a scout who is well-practised at
smelling out things and who has not damaged his sense
of smell by smoking, can often smell an enemy a good
distance away. I have done it many times myself and
found it of the greatest value.</p>

<p class='c005'>When patrolling at night, scouts keep closer together
than by day, and in very dark places, such as woods, etc.,
they should keep touch with each other by each catching
hold of the end of the next scout's staff.</p>

<p class='c005'>When working singly the scout's staff is most
useful for feeling the way in the dark, and pushing aside
dry branches, etc.</p>

<p class='c005'>Scouts working apart from each other in the dark keep
up communication by occasionally giving the call of
their patrol-animal. Any enemy would thus not be
made suspicious.</p>

<p class='c005'>All scouts have to guide themselves very much by
the stars at night.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>WEATHER WISDOM.</h5>
<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Weather.</span>&mdash;Every scout ought to be able to read signs
of the weather, especially when going mountaineering
or cruising, and to read a barometer.</p>

<p class='c005'>He should remember the following points:</p>

<h5 class='c012'><i>PRACTICES.</i></h5>
<p class='c004'><i>Practise roping scouts together for mountain climbing.
Practise (if boats available) coming alongside, making
fast, sculling, punting, laying oars, coiling ropes, etc.,
and other details of boat management. Read barometer.</i></p>
<h5 class='c012'><i>GAMES IN LIFE IN THE OPEN.</i></h5>
<h5 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Night Patrolling.</span></h5>
<p class='c004'><i>Practise scouts to hear and see by night by posting
some sentries, who must stand or walk about, armed with
rifles and blank cartridges, or with whistles. Other
scouts should be sent out as enemies to stalk and kill
them. If a sentry hears a sound he fires, calls, or whistles.
Scouts must at once halt and lie still. The umpire
comes to the sentry and asks which direction the sound
came from, and, if correct, the sentry wins. If the
stalker can creep up within 15 yards of the sentry
without being seen, he deposits some article, such as a
handkerchief, on the ground at that point, and creeps
away again. Then he makes a noise for the sentry to
fire at, and when the umpire comes up, he can explain
what he has done.</i></p>
<h5 class='c012'>GAMES.</h5>
<h5 class='c012'><span class='sc'>A Whale Hunt.</span></h5>
<p class='c004'>The whale is made of a big log of wood with a roughly
shaped head and tail to represent a whale. Two boats
will usually carry out the whale hunt, each boat manned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>by one patrol&mdash;the patrol leader acting as captain, the
corporal as bowman or harpooner, the remainder of the
patrol as oarsmen. Each boat belongs to a different
harbour, the two harbours being about a mile apart.
The umpire takes the whale and lets it loose about halfway
between the two harbours, and on a given signal,
the two boats race out to see who can get to the whale
first. The harpooner who first arrives within range of
the whale drives his harpoon into it, and the boat
promptly turns round and tows the whale to its harbour.
The second boat pursues, and when it overtakes the
other, also harpoons the whale, turns round, and
endeavours to tow the whale back to its harbour. In
this way the two boats have a tug-of-war, and eventually
the better boat tows the whale, and, possibly, the
opposing boat into its harbour. It will be found that
discipline and strict silence and attention to the captain's
orders are very strong points towards winning the game.
It shows, above all things, the value of discipline. The
game is similar to one described in E. Thompson Seton's
"Birchbark of the Woodcraft Indians."</p>

themselves about in the mountains; after breakfast a
party of hounds go out to find them before a certain
hour, say 4 p.m. If they find them, even with field
glasses, it counts, provided that the finder can say
definitely who it was he spotted. Certain limits of ground
must be given, beyond which anyone would be out of
bounds, and therefore disqualified.</p>

</div>
<p class='c004'>Finding the Way&mdash;Judging Distances&mdash;Finding the
North.</p>
<p class='c004'>Among the Red Indian scouts the man who was good
at finding his way in a strange country was termed a
"Pathfinder," which was with them a name of great
honour, because a scout who cannot find his way is of
very little use.</p>

<p class='c005'>Many a tenderfoot has got lost in the veldt or forest,
and has never been seen again, through not having
learned a little scouting, or what is called "eye for a
country," when a boy. I have known many instances of
it myself.</p>

<p class='c005'>In one case a man got off a coach, which was driving
through the bush in Matabeleland, for a few minutes,
while the mules were being changed. He apparently
walked off a few yards into the bush, and when the
coach was ready to start they called for him in every
direction, and searched for him, but were unable to find
him; and at last, the coach being unable to wait any
longer, pursued its journey, leaving word for the lost
man to be sought for. Full search was made for him;
his tracks were followed as far as they could be, in the
very difficult soil of that country, but he was not found
for weeks afterwards, and then his dead body was discovered
nearly fifteen miles away from where he started,
and close to the road.</p>

<p class='c005'>It often happens that when you are tramping along
alone through the bush, or even in a town, you become
careless in noticing what direction you are moving in;
that is, you frequently change it to get round a fallen
tree, or some rocks, or some other obstacle, and having
passed it, you do not take up exactly the correct direction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>again, and a man's inclination somehow is to keep
edging to his right, and the consequence is that when
you think you are going straight, you are really not
doing so at all; and unless you watch the sun, or your
compass, or your landmarks, you are very apt to find
yourself going round in a big circle after a short
time.</p>

<p class='c005'>In such a case a tenderfoot, when he suddenly finds
himself out of his bearings, and lost alone in the desert
or forest, at once loses his head and gets excited, and probably
begins to run, when the right thing to do is to force
yourself to keep cool and give yourself something useful
to do&mdash;that is, to track your own spoor back again; or,
if you fail, start getting firewood for making signal fires
to direct those who are looking for you.</p>

<p class='c005'>The main point is not to get lost in the first instance.</p>

<p class='c005'>Every old scout on first turning out in the morning
notices which way the wind is blowing.</p>

<p class='c005'>When you start out for a walk or on patrol, you
should notice which direction, by the compass, you start
in, and also notice which direction the wind is blowing,
as that would be a great help to you in keeping your
direction, especially if you have not got a compass, or if
the sun is not shining.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then you should notice all landmarks for finding your
way, that is, in the country notice any hills or prominent
towers, steeples, curious trees, rocks, gates, mounds,
bridges, and so on; any points, in fact, by which you
could find your way back again, or by which you could
instruct anyone to go the same line which you have
gone. If you notice your landmarks going out you can
always find your way back by them, but you should take
care occasionally to look back at them after passing
them, so that you get to know their appearance for your
return journey. The same holds good when you are in
a town, or when you arrive in a new town by train; the
moment you step out from the station notice where the
sun is, or which way the smoke is blowing. Also notice
your landmarks, which would be prominent buildings,
churches, factory chimneys, names of streets and shops,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>etc., so that when you have gone down numerous streets
you can turn round and find your way back again to the
station without any difficulty. It is wonderfully easy
when you have practised it a little, yet many people get
lost when they have turned a few corners in a town which
they do not know.</p>

<p class='c005'>The way to find which way the wind is blowing if
there is only very light air is to throw up little bits of
dry grass, or to hold up a handful of light dust and let it
fall, or to suck your thumb and wet it all round and let
the wind blow on it, and the cold side of it will then tell
you which way the wind is blowing. When you are acting
as scout to find the way for a party you should move
ahead of them and fix your whole attention on what you
are doing, because you have to go by the very smallest
signs, and if you get talking and thinking of other things
you are very apt to miss them. Old scouts are generally
very silent people, from having got into this habit of
fixing their attention on the work in hand. Very often
you see a "tenderfoot" out for the first time, thinking
that the leading scout looks lonely, will go and walk or
ride alongside of him and begin a conversation, until the
scout shows him by his manner or otherwise that he does
not particularly want him there. On Thames steamers
you see a notice, "Don't speak to the man at the wheel,"
and the same thing applies with a scout who is guiding a
party. When acting as scout you must keep all your
thoughts on the one subject, like Kim did when Lurgan
tried to mesmerise him.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>JUDGING HEIGHTS AND DISTANCES.</h5>
<p class='c004'>Every scout must be able to judge distance from an
inch up to a mile and more. You ought, first of all, to
know exactly what is the span of your hand and the
breadth of your thumb, and the length from your elbow
to your wrist, and the length from one hand to the other
with your arms stretched out to either side, and also the
length of your feet; if you remember these accurately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>they are a great help to you in measuring things. Also
it is useful to cut notches on your staff, showing such
measurements as one inch, six inches, one foot, and one
yard. These you can measure off with a tape measure
before you use your staff, and they may come in very
useful.</p>

<p class='c005'>Judging the distance of objects from you is only
gained by practice, and judging the distance of a journey
is generally estimated by seeing how long you have been
travelling, and at what rate; that is to say, supposing
you walk at the rate of four miles an hour, if you have
been walking for an hour and a half you know that you
have done about six miles.</p>

<p class='c005'>Distance can also be judged by sound; that is to say,
if you see a gun fired in the distance, and you count the
number of seconds between the flash and the sound of the
explosion reaching you, you will be able to tell how far
off you are from the gun.</p>

<p class='c005'>Sound travels at the rate of 365 feet in a second; that
is, as many feet as there are days in the year.</p>

<p class='c005'>A scout must also be able to estimate heights, from a
few inches up to two or three thousand feet or more;
that is to say, he ought to be able to judge the height of
a fence, the depth of a ditch, or the height of an embankment,
of a house, tree, of a tower, or hill, or
mountain. It is easy to do when once you have practised
it for a few times, but it is very difficult to teach it
by book.</p>

<p class='c005'>You must also know how to estimate weights, from a
letter of an ounce, or a fish, or a potato of one pound, or
a sack of bran, or a cartload of coals; and also the
probable weight of a man from his appearance&mdash;these,
again, are only learnt by practice, but as a scout you
should take care to learn them for yourself.</p>

<p class='c005'>Also you should be able to judge of numbers; that is
to say, you should be able to tell at a glance <i>about</i> how
many people are in a group, or on a 'bus, or in a big
crowd, how many sheep in a flock, how many marbles
on a tray, and so on. These you can practise for yourself
at all times in the street or field.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>In the German Army instructions for judging distance
are given as follows:</p>

<p class='c005'>At fifty yards, mouth and eyes of the enemy can be
clearly seen.</p>

<p class='c005'>At 100 yards, eyes appear as dots; 200 yards, buttons
and details of uniform can still be seen. At 300 yards,
face can be seen; at 400 yards, the movement of the
legs can be seen; at 500 yards the colour of the uniform
can be seen.</p>

<p class='c005'>For distances over these, think out for yourself which
point is halfway to the object. Estimate how far this
may be from you, and then double it to obtain the
distance. Or another way is to estimate the furthest
distance that the object can be away, and then the very
nearest it could be, and strike a mean between the two.</p>

<p class='c005'>Objects appear nearer than they really are: First,
when the light is bright and shining on the object;
secondly, when looking across water or snow, or looking
uphill or down. Objects appear further off when in the
shade; across a valley; when the background is of the
same colour; when the observer is lying down or
kneeling; when there is a heat haze over the ground.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>FINDING THE NORTH.</h5>
<p class='c004'>Every sailor boy knows the points of the compass by
heart and so should a scout. I have talked a good deal
about the north, and you will understand that it is a most
important help to a scout in pathfinding to know the
direction of the north.</p>

<p class='c005'>If you have not a compass the sun will tell you by
day where the north is, and the moon and the stars by
night.</p>

<p class='c005'>At six o'clock in the morning the sun is due east, at
nine o'clock he is south-east, at noon he is south, at
three o'clock in the afternoon he is south-west, and at
six o'clock he is due west. In winter he will have set
long before six o'clock, but he will not have reached due
west when he is set.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>The Phoenicians who sailed round Africa in ancient
times noticed that when they started the sun rose on
their left-hand side&mdash;they were going south. Then they
reported that they got to a strange country where the
sun got up in the wrong quarter, namely, on their right-hand.
The truth was that they had gone round the Cape
of Good Hope and were steering north again up the east
side of Africa.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id007'>
<img src='images/fig093.jpg' alt='Directions.' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Directions.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>To find the south at any time of day by the sun&mdash;hold
your watch flat, face upwards, so that the sun shines on
it. Turn it round till the hour hand points at the sun.
Then, without moving the watch, lay the edge of a piece
of paper or a pencil across the face of the watch so that
it rests on the centre of the dial and points out halfway
between the Figure XII. and the hour hand. The line
given by that pencil will be the true south and north line.</p>

<p class='c005'>(<i>Instructor should make each boy find the south for
himself with a watch</i>).</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span><span class='sc'>The Stars.</span>&mdash;The stars appear to circle over us during
the night, which is really due to our earth turning round
under them.</p>

<p class='c005'>There are various groups which have got names given
to them because they seem to make some kind of pictures
or "sky-signs" of men and animals.</p>

<p class='c005'>The "Plough" is an easy one to find, being shaped
something like a plough. And it is the most useful one
for a scout to know, because in the northern part of the
world it shows him exactly where the north is. The
Plough is also called the "Great Bear," and the four
stars in the curve make its tail. It is the only bear I
know of that wears a long tail.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id007'>
<img src='images/fig094.jpg' alt='Great Bear.' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Great Bear.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The two stars in the Plough called the "Pointers"
point out where the North or Pole Star is. All the stars
and constellations move round, as I have said, during the
night, but the Pole Star remains fixed in the north.
There is also the "Little Bear" near the Great Bear,
and the last star in his tail is the North or Pole Star.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>The sky may be compared to an umbrella over you.
The pole star is where the stick goes through the centre
of it.</p>

<p class='c005'>A real umbrella has been made with all the stars
marked on it in their proper places. If you stand under
it and twist it slowly round you see exactly how the stars
quietly go round, but the Pole Star remains steady in
the middle.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then another set of stars or "constellation," as it is
called, represents a man wearing a sword and belt, and
is named "Orion." It is easily recognised by the three
stars in line, which are the belt, and three smaller stars
in another line, close by which are the sword. Then
two stars to right and left below the sword are his feet,
while two more above the belt are his shoulders, and
a group of three small stars between them make his
head.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now the great point about Orion is that by him you
always can tell which way the north or Pole Star lies,
and which way the south, and you can see him whether
you are in the south or the north part of the world. The
Great Bear you only see when you are in the north, and
the Southern Cross when you are in the south.</p>

<p class='c005'>If you draw a line, by holding up your staff against the
sky, from the centre star of Orion's belt through the
centre of his head, and carry that line on through two
big stars till it comes to a third, that third one is the
North or Pole star.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then if you draw a line the other way, beginning
again with the centre star of the belt, and passing
through the centre star of the sword your line goes
through another group of stars shaped like the letter L.
And if you go about as far again past L, you come to
the South Pole, which unfortunately is not marked by
any star.</p>

<p class='c005'>Roughly, Orion's sword&mdash;the three small stars&mdash;points
north and south.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Zulu scouts call Orion's belt and sword the
"Ingolubu," or three pigs pursued by three dogs. The
Masai in East Africa say that the three stars in Orion's
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>belt are three bachelors being followed by three old
maids. You see scouts all know Orion, though under
different names.</p>

<h5 class='c012'>HINTS TO INSTRUCTORS.</h5>
<h5 class='c012'><i>PRACTICES IN PATHFINDING.</i></h5>
<p class='c004'><i>Teach the boys to recognise the Great Bear and the
Pole Star, and Orion; to judge time by the sun; find
the south by the watch. Practise map reading and finding
the way by the map; and mark off roads by blazing,
broken branches, and signs drawn on the ground. Practise
judging distance, heights and weights, and numbers.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>The way to estimate the distance across a river is to
take an object X, such as a tree or rock on the opposite
bank; start off at right angles to it from A, and pace,
say, ninety yards along your bank; on arriving at sixty
yards, plant a stick or stone, B; on arriving at C,
thirty yards beyond that, that is ninety from the start,
turn at right angles and walk inland, counting your
paces until you bring the stick and the distant tree in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>line; the number of paces that you have taken from the
bank C D will then give you the half distance across A X.</i></p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Height.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'><i>To find the height of an object, such as a tree (A X), or
a house, pace a distance of, say, eight yards away from it,
and there at B plant a stick, say, six feet high; then
pace on until you arrive at a point where the top of the
stick comes in line C with the top of the tree; then the
whole distance A C from the foot is to A X, the height of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>the tree, the same as the distance B C, from the stick, is to
the height of the stick; that is if the whole distance A C
is thirty-three feet, and the distance B C from the stick is
nine (the stick being six feet high), the tree is twenty-two
feet high.</i></p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. G. L. Boundy, of Exeter, has been practising his
boys in judging distances in the following manner:</p>

<p class='c005'><i>He has a board put up on which are given the actual
distances and heights and measurements of the various
streets and buildings round about with which they are
well acquainted. This gives the boys a standard to
work upon, and they then go out and guess heights and
distances, and other objects given to them by Mr.
Boundy, who has previously ascertained their correct
measurements by inquiry or otherwise. In this way
they are able to learn a good deal of the subject in the
immediate neighbourhood in the middle of the town.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>It is often useful for the instructor, if he has a
bicycle, to measure a number of distances beforehand
by running over them and counting the revolutions of his
wheel. He can then make the boys guess those distances,
and can check them, knowing the correct distance himself.</i></p>
<h5 class='c012'>GAMES IN PATHFINDING.</h5>
<p class='c004'>Instructor takes a patrol in patrolling formation into a
strange town or into an intricate piece of strange
country, with a cycling map. He then gives instructions
as to where he wants to go to, makes each scout in turn
lead the patrol, say for seven minutes if cycling, fifteen
minutes if walking. This scout is to find the way
entirely by the map, and marks are given for ability in
reading, that is to say, each scout is given ten marks on
starting, and one is deducted for every mistake that he
makes. If he makes no mistake at all throughout
the exercise, his ten small marks will count as one real
scout mark towards a badge "of merit."</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Star-gazing.</span>&mdash;Take out the scouts on clear nights and
post them separately, and let each find the North Star and
Orion, etc., and point them out to you as you come round.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span><span class='sc'>Judging Distance.</span>&mdash;Take a patrol and station its
members about in different directions and with different
background, according to the colour of their clothes;
then take another patrol to judge distance of these
points. Two competitors are sent in turn to three different
points. At the first point they are merely given
the compass bearing of the next one, which is some three
hundred yards distant, and so on in succession. At each
point each pair of scouts notices regarding the enemy&mdash;first,
how many visible; second, how far off; third, what
is their compass direction; fourth, how they are clothed.
The best answers win provided they are within the
specified time. The time allowed should be one minute
for observation at each station, and half a minute for
each bit of running.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Find the North.</span>&mdash;Scouts are posted thirty yards
apart, and each lays down his staff on the ground pointing
to what he considers the exact north (or south),
without using any instrument. The umpire compares
each stick with the compass; the one who guesses
nearest wins. This is a useful game to play at night or
on sunless days as well as sunny days.</p>

</div>
<p class='c004'>Hidden Despatches&mdash;Signalling&mdash;Whistle and Flag-Signals.</p>
<p class='c004'>Scouts have to be very clever at passing news secretly
from one place to another, or signalling to each other;
and if it should ever happen that an enemy got into
England, the Boy Scouts would be of greatest value if
they have practised this art.</p>

<p class='c005'>Before the siege of Mafeking commenced, I received
a secret message from some unknown friend in the
Transvaal, who sent me news of the Boers' plans against
the place, and the numbers that they were getting
together of men, horses, and guns. This news came to
me by means of a very small letter which was rolled up
in a little ball, the size of a pill, and put inside a tiny hole
in a rough walking stick, and plugged in there with wax.
The stick was given to a native, who merely had orders
to come into Mafeking and give me the stick as a
present. Naturally, when he brought me this stick, and
said it was from another white man, I guessed there
must be something inside it, and soon found this very
important letter.</p>

<p class='c005'>Also I received another letter from a friend, which
was written in Hindustani language, but in English
writing, so that anybody reading would be quite puzzled
as to what language it was written in; but to me it was
all as clear as daylight.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then when we sent letters out from Mafeking, we
used to give them to natives, who were able to creep
out between the Boer outposts, and once through the
line of sentries, the Boers mistook them for their own
natives, and took no further notice of them. They
carried their letters in this way. The letters were all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>written on thin paper in small envelopes, and half a
dozen letters or more would be crumpled up tightly into
a little ball, and then rolled up into a piece of lead paper,
such as tea is packed in. The native scout would carry
a number of these little balls in his hand, and hanging
round his neck loosely by strings. Then, if he saw he
was in danger of being captured by a Boer, he would
drop all his balls on the ground, where they looked
exactly like so many stones, and he would notice landmarks
from two or three points round about him, by
which he would be able again to find the exact spot
where the letters were lying; then he would walk boldly
on until accosted by the Boer, who, if he searched him,
would have found nothing suspicious about him. He would
then wait about for perhaps a day or two until the coast
was clear, and come back to the spot where the landmarks
told him the letters were lying.</p>

<p class='c005'>"Landmarks," you may remember, mean any objects,
like trees, mounds, rocks, or other details which do not
move away, and act as signposts for a scout who notices
and remembers them.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>SIGNALLING.</h5>
<p class='c004'>Captain John Smith was one of the first to make use
of signals to express regular words, three hundred years
ago.</p>

<p class='c005'>He was then fighting on the side of the Austrians
against the Turks. He thought it wicked for Christian
men to fight against Christians if it could possibly be
avoided, but he would help any Christian, although a
foreigner, to fight against a heathen; so he joined the
Austrians against the Turks.</p>

<p class='c005'>He invented a system of showing lights at night with
torches, which when held in certain positions with each
other meant certain words.</p>

<p class='c005'>Several officers in the Austrian forces practised these
signals till they knew them.</p>

<p class='c005'>On one occasion one of these officers was besieged by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>the Turks. John Smith brought a force to help him,
and arrived on a hill near the town in the night. Here he
made a number of torch signals, which were read by the
officer inside, and they told him what to do when Smith
attacked the enemy in the rear; and this enabled the
garrison to break out successfully.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the American Civil War, Captain Clowry, a scout
officer, wanted to give warning to a large force of his
own army that the enemy were going to attack it unexpectedly
during the night, but he could not get to his
friends, because there was a flooded river between them
which he could not cross, and a storm of rain was going
on.</p>

<p class='c005'>What would you have done if you had been him?</p>

<p class='c005'>A good idea struck him. He got hold of an old railway
engine that was standing near him. He lit the fire,
and got up steam in her, and then started to blow the
whistle with short and long blasts&mdash;what is called the
Morse alphabet. Soon his friends heard and understood,
and answered back with a bugle. And he then spelt out
a message of warning to them, which they read and
acted upon. And so their force of 20,000 men was
saved from surprise.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lieutenant Boyd-Alexander describes in his book
"From the Niger to the Nile," how a certain tribe of
natives in Central Africa signal news to each other by
means of beats on a drum. And I have known tribes
in the forests of the West Coast of Africa who do the
same.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Morse and Semaphore Codes.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Every scout ought to learn the "dot and dash" or
Morse method of signalling, because it comes in most
useful whenever you want to send messages some distance
by flag signalling, as in the Army and Navy, and it is also
useful in getting you employment as a telegraphist. It
is not difficult to learn if you set about it with a will. I
found it most useful once during the Boer War. My
column had been trying to get past a Boer force who
was holding a pass in the mountains. Finding they
were too strong for us, we gave it up late in the evening,
and leaving a lot of fires alight as if we were in camp in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>front of them, we moved during the night by a
rapid march right round the end of the mountain range,
and by daylight next day we were exactly in rear of
them without their knowing it. We then found a telegraph
line evidently leading from them to their headquarters
some fifty miles further off, so we sat down by
the telegraph wire and attached our own little wire to it
and read all the messages they were sending, and they
gave us most valuable information. But we should not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>have been able to do that had it not been that some of
our scouts could read the Morse code.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then the semaphore signalling, which is done by
waving your arms at different angles to each other, is
most useful and quite easy to learn, and is known by
every soldier and sailor in the service. Here you have
all the different letters, and the different angles at which
you have to put your arms to represent those letters, and
though it looks complicated in the picture, when you
come to work it out, you will find it is very simple.</p>

<p class='c005'>For all letters from A to G the right arm only is used,
making a quarter of a circle for each letter in succession.
Then from H to N (except J), the right arm stands at A,
while the left moves round the circle again for the other
letters. From O to S the right arm stands at B, and the
left arm moves round as before. For T, V, Y, and the
"annul" the right arm stands at C, the left moving to
the next point of the circle successively.</p>

<p class='c005'>The letters A to K also mean figures 1 to 9, if you
first make the sign <b>Y</b>
to show that you are going to send numbers.</p>

<p class='c005'>If you want to write a despatch that will puzzle
most people to read, use the Morse or Semaphore letters
in place of the ordinary alphabet. It will be quite
readable to any of your friends who understand
signalling.</p>

<p class='c005'>Also if you want to use a secret language in your
patrol you should all set to work to learn "Esperanto."
It is not difficult, and is taught in a little book costing
one penny. This language is being used in all countries
so that you would be able to get on with it abroad now.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>WHISTLE AND FLAG SIGNALS.</h5>
<p class='c004'>Each patrol leader should provide himself with a
whistle and a lanyard or cord for keeping it. The
following commands and signals should be at your finger
ends, so that you can teach them to your patrol, and
know how to order it properly.</p>

<h5 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Signals and Signs.</span></h5>
<p class='c004'>When a scoutmaster wants to call his troop together
he makes his bugler sound the "The Scout's Call."</p>

<p class='c005'>Patrol leaders thereupon call together their patrols by
sounding their whistles, followed by their patrol (animal)
war cry. Then they double their patrol to the scoutmaster.</p>

<p class='c009'>Whistle Signals are these: One long blast means:
"Silence;" "Alert;" "Look out for my next signal."</p>

<p class='c010'>1. A succession of long slow blasts means: "Go
out;" "Get further away;" or "Advance;"
"Extend;" "Scatter."</p>

<p class='c010'>2. A succession of short, sharp blasts means: "Rally;"
"Close in;" "Come together;" "Fall in."</p>

<p class='c010'>3. A succession of short and long blasts alternately
means: "Alarm;" "Look out;" "Be ready;"
"Man your alarm posts."</p>

<p class='c010'>4. Three short blasts followed by one long one, from
scoutmaster calls up the patrol leaders&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
"Leaders come here!"</p>

<p class='c007'>Any whistle signal must be instantly obeyed at the
double as fast as ever you can run&mdash;no matter what
other job you may be doing at the time.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hand Signals, which can also be made by patrol leaders
with their patrol flags when necessary.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hand waved several times across the face from side
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>to side, or flag waved horizontally from side to side opposite
the face means: "No; Never mind; As you were."</p>

<p class='c005'>Hand or flag held high, and waved very slowly from
side to side at full extent of arm, or whistle a succession
of slow blasts means: "Extend; Go further out; Scatter."</p>

<p class='c005'>Hand or flag held high and waved quickly from side
to side at full extent of arm, or whistle a succession of
short, quick blasts means: "Close in; Rally; Come here."</p>

<p class='c005'>Hand or flag pointing in any direction means: "Go
in that direction."</p>

<p class='c005'>Hand or flag jumped rapidly up and down several
times, means: "Run."</p>

<p class='c005'>Hand or flag held straight up over head, means:
"Stop;" "Halt."</p>

<p class='c005'>When a leader is shouting an order or message to a
scout who is some way off, the scout, if he hears what is
being said, should hold up his hand level with his head
all the time. If he cannot hear he should stand still
making no sign. The leader will then repeat louder or
beckon to the scout to come in nearer.</p>

<p class='c005'>The following signals are made by a scout with his
staff when he is sent out to reconnoitre within sight of
his patrol, and they have the following meanings: Staff
held up horizontally, that is flat with both hands above
the head, means "a few enemy in sight."</p>

<p class='c005'>The same, but with staff moved up and down slowly,
means "a number of enemy in sight, a long way off."</p>

<p class='c005'>The same, staff moved up and down rapidly means "a
number of enemy in sight, and close by."</p>

<p class='c005'>The staff held straight up over the head means "no
enemy in sight."</p>
<h5 class='c012'>PRACTICES IN SIGNALLING.</h5>
<p class='c004'>Practice laying, lighting, and use of signal fires of
smoke or flame.</p>

<p class='c005'>Practice whistle and drill signals.</p>

<p class='c005'>Teach Semaphore and Morse Codes; also Esperanto
if feasible.</p>

  <h5 class='c012'>HINTS TO INSTRUCTORS.</h5>
</div>
<p class='c004'><i>In all games and competitions, it should be arranged
as far as possible that all the scouts should take part,
because we do not want to have merely one or two
brilliant performers, and the others no use at all. All
ought to get practice, and all ought to be pretty good.
In competitions where there are enough entries to make
heats, ties should be run off by losers instead of the
usual system of by winners, and the game should be to find
out which are the worst instead of which are the best.
Good men will strive just as hard not to be worst, as
they would to gain a prize, and this form of competition
gives the bad man most practice.</i></p>
<h5 class='c012'>MARKS TOWARDS BADGES OF HONOUR IN CAMPAIGNING.</h5>
<p class='c004'>Making a complete model bridge. Up to four marks.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lay and light the following fires separately, using only
six matches for the whole: First, cooking fire, and cook
a bannock. Second, flame signal fire and make signals.
Third, smoke signal fire and make signals. Marks up to
three.</p>

<p class='c005'>To measure without instruments, within ten per cent.
of correctness, three different widths of river, or
impassable ground, without crossing it. Heights of three
different trees or buildings. Number of sheep in a
flock, stones on a table, etc. Weights of four different
things from one ounce up to one hundred pounds. Four
distances between one inch and one mile. Marks up to
five for the whole lot.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>DISPATCH RUNNING.</h5>
<p class='c004'>A scout is given a dispatch to take to the headquarters
of a besieged town, which may be a real town
(village, farm, or house), and he must return with a
receipt for it. He must wear a coloured rag 2ft. long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>pinned on to his shoulder. He must start at least four
miles away from the town he is going to. Besiegers
who have to spot him can place themselves where they
like, but must not go nearer to the headquarters' building
than three hundred yards. (Best to give certain
boundaries that they know or can recognise.) Anyone
found within that limit by the umpire will be ruled out
as shot by the defenders at headquarters. The dispatch
runner can use any ruse he likes, except dressing up as
a woman, but he must always wear the red rag on his
shoulder. To catch him, the enemy must get the red
rag from him. Ten hours may be allowed as the limit
of time, by which the dispatch runner should get his
message to headquarters and get back again to the
starting-point with the receipt. This game may also be
made a life-and-death venture, in which case any scout who
volunteers to risk his life (<i>i.e.</i> his scout's badge) in getting
through with a dispatch, gains the badge "For Merit" if
he wins; but if he fails, he loses his scout's badge (fleurs-de-lis),
and cannot get it again, although he may still
remain a member of the corps. The enemy win three
marks each if they spot him, and lose three marks if he
succeeds. To win a badge of merit there must be not
less than two patrols out against him. A similar game
can be played in a city, but requires modifications to suit
the local conditions.</p>

<h4 class='c012'>HINTS TO INSTRUCTORS. <br /> HOW TO HELP IN A GREAT NATIONAL WORK.</h4>
<p class='c004'><i>Recent reports on the deterioration of our race ought
to act as a warning to be taken in time before it goes
too far.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>One cause which contributed to the downfall of the
Roman Empire was the fact that the soldiers fell
away from the standard of their forefathers in bodily
strength.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>Our standard of height in the Army was 5ft. 6in.
in 1845; it was</i> <span class='fss'>FOUR INCHES</span> <i>less in 1895. In 1900
forty-four men in every thousand recruits weighed
under 7st. 12lbs.; in 1905 this deficiency had increased
to seventy-six per thousand.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>This year our recruits were two inches below the
standard height of men of their age</i>, viz., <i>eighteen to
nineteen, and six pounds under the average weight</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>Three thousand men were sent home from the South
African War on account of bad teeth.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>Reports on school children, made by the London
County Council, show that out of 700 examined only
twenty had sound teeth, 323 had more than five teeth
decayed.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>Out of 1,521 examined for adenoids in the throat
29 per cent. had enlargements, 10 per cent. required
operation. Out of 1,000 boys of thirteen, sons of rich
or well-to-do persons, examined by Dr. Clement Dukes,
526 had knock-knees, 445 had curvature of the spine,
329 flat feet, 126 pigeon-breasts&mdash;all preventable
deformities. In this case, however, the teeth were
well cared for.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span><i>Deafness from adenoids and weak eyesight are also
very prevalent among them.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>Dr. Wright Thomson, in the "British Medical
Journal," September 14th, 1907, shows how town
children suffer greatly from defective sight, which
might be, to a great extent, remedied by special
exercises for the eyes and by good feeding.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>The report [see Blue Book C. D. 3637] last year on
the school children of Glasgow showed their average
weight and height were very much below the standard;
and these varied almost exactly according to the
number of rooms occupied by the family, that is,
according to the air space available.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>These and the many similar reports show that much</i>
<span class='fss'>PREVENTABLE</span> <i>deterioration is being allowed to creep in
among the rising generation</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>Then there is also prevalent a great amount of
illness resulting from self-abuse and venereal disease,
as well as from drink. Also much pauper over-population
due to want of self-restraint on the part of men
and women.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>The training of Boy Scouts would be therefore
incomplete if it did not endeavour to help in remedying
these evils. Some idea is much needed among boys of
their personal hygiene. It has been stated on good
authority that half our losses in the Boer War from
sickness might have been avoided had our men and
officers had any knowledge of personal care of their
health.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>No doubt it is the same in peace time, as numbers of
men are thrown out of work by sickness, which might be
avoided if they knew how to look after themselves, and
took reasonable precautions.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>Since most of these causes of physical decay are
preventable, they open to instructors a field for doing
a work of national value.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>For these reasons the following chapter suggests
the instruction of boys in being PERSONALLY
RESPONSIBLE for their own Strength, Health
and Sanitary Surroundings.</i></p>

<h5 class='c012'>A SCOUT'S ENDURANCE.</h5>
<p class='c004'>A scout lay sick in hospital in India with that most fatal
disease called cholera. The doctor told the native man
in attendance on him that the only chance of saving his
life was to violently warm up his feet and keep the blood
moving in his body by constantly rubbing him. The
moment the doctor's back was turned the native gave up
rubbing and squatted down to have a quiet smoke. The
poor patient, though he could not speak, understood all
that was going on&mdash;and he was so enraged at the conduct
of his native attendant, that he resolved then and there
that he would get well if only to give the native a lesson.
Having made up his mind to get well he <i>got</i> well.</p>

<p class='c005'>A scout's motto is "Never say die till you're dead"&mdash;and
if he acts up to this it will pull him out of many a bad
place when everything seems to be going wrong for him.
It means a mixture of pluck, patience, and strength, which
we call "Endurance."</p>

<p class='c005'>The great South African hunter and scout, F. C. Selous,
gave a great example of scout's endurance when on a
hunting expedition in Barotseland north of the Zambesi
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>River some years ago. In the middle of the night his
camp was suddenly attacked by a hostile tribe who fired
into it at close range and charged in.</p>

<p class='c005'>He and his small party of natives scattered at once
into the darkness and hid themselves away in the long
grass. Selous himself had snatched up his rifle and a
few cartridges and got safely into the grass. But he
could not find any of his men, and seeing that the enemy
had got possession of his camp and that there were still
a few hours of darkness before him in which to make his
escape, he started off southward, using the stars of the
Southern Cross as his guide.</p>

<p class='c005'>He crept past an outpost of the enemy whom he
overheard talking, and then swam across a river and
finally got well away, only dressed in a shirt, and shorts and
shoes. For the next few days and nights he kept
walking southward, having frequently to hide to avoid
hostile natives. He shot deer for food.</p>

<p class='c005'>But one night going into what he thought was a
friendly village he had his rifle stolen from him, and was
again a fugitive without any means of protecting
himself or of getting food. However, he was not one to
give in while there was a chance of life left, and he
pushed on and on till at length he reached a place where
he met some of his men who had also escaped, and after
further tramping they got safely back into friendly
country.</p>

<p class='c005'>But what a terrible time they must have had!</p>

<p class='c005'>Three weeks had passed since the attack, and the
great part of that time Selous had been alone&mdash;hunted,
starving, and bitterly cold at night, and in sweltering
heat by day.</p>

<p class='c005'>None but a scout with extraordinary endurance could
have lived through it, but then Selous is a man who as a
lad had made himself strong by care and exercise; and
he neither drinks nor smokes. And he kept up his pluck
all the time.</p>

<p class='c005'>It shows you that if you want to get through such
adventures safely when you are a man you must train
yourself up to be strong, healthy, and active as a lad.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>
  <h5 class='c012'>EXERCISES AND THEIR OBJECT.</h5>
</div>
<p class='c004'>There is a great deal of nonsense in fashion in the way
of bodily exercises; so many people seem to think that
their only object is to make huge muscle. But to make
yourself strong and healthy it is necessary to begin with
your inside and to get the blood into good order and the
heart to work well; that is the secret of the whole thing,
and physical exercises should be taken with that intention.
This is the way to do it:</p>

<p class='c009'>(<i>a</i>) <span class='sc'>Make the heart strong</span>, in order to pump
the blood properly to every part of the body
and so to build up flesh, bone, and muscle.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Exercise</i>: The "Struggle" and "Wrist
Pushing." See Page <a href='#Page_219'>219</a>.</p>

<p class='c010'>(<i>b</i>) <span class='sc'>Make the lungs strong</span>, in order to revive
the blood with fresh air.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Exercise</i>: "Deep breathing." See Page <a href='#Page_227'>227</a>.</p>

<p class='c010'>(<i>c</i>) <span class='sc'>Make the skin perspire</span>, to get rid of the dirt
from the blood.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Exercise</i>: Bath, or dry rub with a damp
towel every day.</p>

<p class='c010'>(<i>d</i>) <span class='sc'>Make the stomach work</span>, to feed the blood.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Exercise</i>: "Cone," or "Body Bending,"
and "Twisting." See Page <a href='#Page_237'>237</a>.</p>

<p class='c010'>(<i>e</i>) <span class='sc'>Make the bowels active</span>, to remove the
remains of food and dirt from the body.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Exercise</span>: "Body Bending" and "Kneading
the Abdomen." Drink plenty of good
water. Regular daily "rear."</p>

<p class='c010'>(<i>f</i>) <span class='sc'>Work muscles in each part of the body</span>,
to make the blood circulate to that part, and so
increase your strength.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>Exercise</i>: Running and walking, and special
exercises of special muscles, such as "Wrist
Pushing," etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>The secret of keeping well and healthy is to keep your
blood clean and active. These different exercises will
do that if you will use them everyday. Someone has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>said, "If you practise body exercises every morning you
will never be ill: and if you also drink a pint of hot
water every night you will never die."</p>

<p class='c005'>The blood thrives on simple good food, plenty of
exercise, plenty or fresh air, cleanliness of the body both
inside and out, and proper rest of body and mind at
intervals.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Japs are particularly strong and healthy, as was
shown in the late war with Russia. There was very
little sickness among them and those who were wounded
generally very quickly recovered because their skin was
clean and their blood was in a healthy, sound condition.
They are the best example that we can copy. They
keep themselves very clean by having two or three
baths every day.</p>

<p class='c005'>They eat very plain food, chiefly rice and fruit, and
not much of it. They drink plenty of water, but no
spirits. They take lots of exercise. They make themselves
good-tempered and do not worry their brain.
They live in fresh air as much as possible day and
night. Their particular exercise is "Ju-Jitsu," which is
more of a game than drill and is generally played in
pairs. And pupils get to like the game so much that
they generally go on with it after their course of instruction
has finished.</p>

<p class='c005'>By Ju-Jitsu, the muscles and body are developed in a
natural way in the open air as a rule. It requires no
apparatus, and once the muscles have been formed by it
they do not disappear again when you cease the
practices as is the case in ordinary gymnastics.</p>

<p class='c005'>Admiral Kamimura, the great Admiral of our friends
the Japanese, strongly recommends all young men and
lads to practise Ju-Jitsu, as it not only makes them strong,
but also quick in the mind.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>THE NOSE.</h5>
<p class='c004'>A scout must be able to smell well in order to find his
enemy by night. If he always breathes through the nose
and not through the mouth this helps him considerably.
But there are other reasons more important than that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>for always breathing through the nose. Fifty years ago,
Mr. Catlin in America wrote a book called "Shut your
mouth and save your life," and he showed how the Red
Indians for a long time had adopted that method with
their children to the extent of tying up their jaws at
night to ensure their only breathing through their nose.</p>

<p class='c005'>Breathing through the nose prevents germs of disease
getting from the air into the throat and stomach, it also
prevents a growth in the back of the throat called
"adenoids" which are apt to stop the breathing power
of the nostrils, and also to cause deafness.</p>

<p class='c005'>For a scout nose-breathing is also specially useful.</p>

<p class='c005'>By keeping the mouth shut you prevent yourself from
getting thirsty when you are doing hard work. And
also at night if you are in the habit of breathing through
the nose it prevents snoring, and snoring is a dangerous
thing if you are sleeping anywhere in an enemy's
country. Therefore practise keeping your mouth shut
and breathing through your nose at all times.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>EARS.</h5>
<p class='c004'>A scout must be able to hear well. Generally the ears
are very delicate and once damaged are apt to become
incurably deaf. People are too apt to fiddle about with
their ears in cleaning them by putting the corners of
handkerchiefs, hairpins and so on into them, and also
stuffing them up with hard cotton wool, all of which are
dangerous with such a delicate organ as the ear, the
drum of the ear being a very delicate, tightly-stretched
skin which is easily damaged. Very many children have
had the drums of their ears permanently injured by
getting a box on the ear.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>EYES.</h5>
<p class='c004'>A scout, of course, must have particularly good
eyesight; he must be able to see anything very quickly
and to see at a long way off. By practising your eyes
in looking at things at a great distance they will grow
stronger. While you are young you should save your
eyes as much as possible, or they are not strong when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>you get older: therefore avoid reading by lamplight as
much as possible and also sit with your back or side to
the light when doing any work during the day; if you sit
facing the light it strains your eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>The strain of the eyes is a very common failure with
growing boys, although very often they do not know
it, and headaches come most frequently from the eyes
being strained; frowning on the part of a boy is very
generally a sign that his eyes are being strained.</p>

<p class='c005'>A scout, besides having good eyesight, must be able to
tell the colour of things which he sees. Colour blindness
is a great infliction which some boys suffer from. It
takes away a pleasure from them, and it also makes them
useless for certain trades and professions.</p>

<p class='c005'>For instance, a railway signalman or engine-driver or
a sailor would not be much good if he couldn't tell the
difference between red and green.</p>

<p class='c005'>It can very often be cured, and a simple way of doing
this, if you find you are rather colour blind, is to get a
collection of little bits of wool, or paper, of every
different kind of colour, and pick out which you think is
red, blue, yellow, green, and so on, and then get
someone to tell you where you were right and where
wrong. Then you go at it again, and in time you will
find yourself improving, until you have no difficulty in
recognising the right colours. It is better still to
practise by looking at coloured lights at night in
chemists' shops, railway signals, etc.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>TEETH.</h5>
<p class='c004'>A would-be recruit came up to the recruiting officer
to be enlisted during the Boer War. He was found to be
a sufficiently strong and well-made man but when they
came to examine his teeth they found that these were in
bad condition, and he was told that he could not be
accepted as a soldier. To this he replied: "But, sir, that
seems hard lines. Surely we don't have to eat the
enemy when we've killed them, do we?"</p>

<p class='c005'>A scout with bad teeth is no use at all for scouting
work, because he has to live on hard biscuits and hard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>meat which he cannot possibly eat or digest if his teeth
are not good, and good teeth depend upon how you look
after them when you are young, it means that you should
keep them very carefully clean. At least twice a day
they should be brushed, when you get up in the morning
and when you go to bed, both inside and out, with a
tooth brush and tooth powder; and should be rinsed with
water if possible after every meal but especially after
eating fruit or acid food.</p>

<p class='c005'>Scouts in the jungle cannot always find tooth brushes,
but they make substitutes out of dry sticks which they
fray out at the end and make an imitation of a brush.</p>

<p class='c005'>Three thousand men had to be sent away from the war
in South Africa because their teeth were so bad that
they could not chew the hard biscuits, etc., on which they
had to live there.</p>

<p class='c005'>"Out West," in America, cowboys are generally
supposed to be pretty rough customers, but they are in
reality peace scouts of a high order. They live a hard
life doing hard and dangerous work far away from towns
and civilisation&mdash;where nobody sees them. But there
is one civilised thing that they do&mdash;they clean their
teeth every day, morning and evening.</p>

<p class='c005'>Years ago I was travelling through Natal on horseback,
and I was anxious to find a lodging for the night,
when I came across a hut evidently occupied by a white
man, but nobody was about. In looking round inside
the hut, I noticed that though it was very roughly
furnished there were several tooth-brushes on what
served as a wash-hand stand, so I guessed that the
owner must be a decent fellow, and I made myself at home
until he came in, and I found that I had guessed aright.</p>

</div>
<h5 class='c012'><i>PRACTICES IN DEVELOPING STRENGTH.</i></h5>
<h5 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Measurement of the Boy.</span></h5>
<p class='c004'><i>It is of paramount importance to teach the young
citizen to assume responsibility for his own development
and health.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>Physical drill is all very well as a disciplinary means
of development, but it does not give the lad any
responsibility in the matter.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>It is therefore deemed preferable to tell each boy,
according to his age, what ought to be his height,
weight, and various measurements (such as chest, waist,
arm, leg, etc.). He is then measured, and learns in
which points he fails to come up to the standard. He
can then be shown which exercises to practise for himself
in order to develop those particular points.
Encouragement must afterwards be given by periodical
measurements, say every three months or so.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>Cards can be obtained from the "Boy Scouts" Office,
Henrietta Street, London, W.C., which, besides giving
the standard measurements for the various ages, give
columns to be filled in periodically showing the boy's
re-measurements and progress in development. If each
boy has his card it is a great incentive to him to
develope himself at odd times when he has a few
minutes to spare.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>Teach how to make camp tooth brushes out of sticks.
"Dragon-root" sticks for cleaning teeth can be got at
chemists' shops as samples.</i></p>
<h5 class='c012'>GAMES TO DEVELOP STRENGTH.</h5>
<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Boxing</span>, wrestling, rowing, skipping, cock-fighting, are
all valuable health aids to developing strength.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Old Spotty-face</span> (To develop eyesight).&mdash;Prepare
squares of cardboard divided into about a dozen small
squares. Each scout should take one, and should
have a pencil and go off a few hundred yards, or, if
indoors, as far as space will allow. The umpire then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>takes a large sheet of cardboard, with twelve squares
ruled on it of about three inch sides if in the open, or
one and a half to two inches if indoors. The umpire
has a number of black paper discs (half an inch diameter)
and pins ready, and sticks about half a dozen on to his
card, dotted about where he likes. He holds up his
card so that it can be seen by the scouts. They then
gradually approach, and as they get within sight they
mark their cards with the same pattern of spots. The
one who does so at the farthest distance from the umpire
wins. Give five points for every spot correctly shown,
deduct one point for every two inches nearer than the
furthest man. This teaches long sight.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>"<span class='sc'>Quick Sight</span>" can also be taught with the same
apparatus, by allowing the scouts to come fairly close,
and then merely showing your card for five seconds, and
let them mark their cards from memory. The one who
is most correct wins.</p>

<p class='c005'>"<span class='sc'>The Struggle.</span>"&mdash;Two players face each other about
a yard apart, stretch arms out sideways, lock fingers of
both hands, and lean towards each other till their chests
touch, push chest to chest, and see who can drive the
other back to the wall of the room or on to a goal line.
At first a very short struggle is sufficient to set their
hearts pumping, but after practice for a few days the
heart grows stronger and they can go on for a long
time.</p>

<p class='c005'>"<span class='sc'>Wrist Pushing</span>" by one man alone. Stand with
both your arms to the front about level with the waist,
cross your wrists so that one hand has knuckles up, the
other knuckles down. Clench the fists.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now make the lower hand press upwards and make
the upper hand press downwards.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>Press as hard as you can with both wrists gradually,
and only after great resistance let the lower push the
upper one upwards till opposite your fore-head, then let
the upper press the lower down, the lower one resisting
all the time.</p>

<p class='c005'>These two exercises, although they sound small and
simple, if carried out with all your might, develop most
muscles in your body and especially those about the
heart. They should not be carried on too long at a time,
but should be done at frequent intervals during the day
for a minute or so.</p>

<p class='c005'>"<span class='sc'>Wrist Pushing</span>" can also be played by two boys
half facing each other, each putting out the wrist nearest
to his opponent, at arm's length; pressing it against the
other's wrist and trying to turn him round backwards.</p>

<h5 class='c012'>HOW TO KEEP HEALTHY.</h5>
<p class='c004'>All the great peace-scouts who have succeeded in
exploring or hunting expeditions in wild countries have
only been able to get on by being pretty good doctors
themselves; because diseases, accidents, and wounds are
always being suffered by them or their men, and they
don't find doctors and chemists' shops in the jungles to
cure them. So that a scout who does not know something
about doctoring would never get on at all; he
might just as well stay at home for all the good he will
be.</p>

<p class='c005'>Therefore, practise keeping healthy yourself, and then
you will be able to show others how to keep themselves
healthy too.</p>

<p class='c005'>In this way you can do many good turns.</p>

<p class='c005'>David Livingstone, the great missionary and peace-scout,
endeared himself to the natives by his cleverness
as a doctor.</p>

<p class='c005'>Also, if you know how to look after yourself you need
never have to pay for medicines. The great English
poet, Dryden, in his poem, "Cymon and Iphigenia,"
wrote that it was better to trust to fresh air and exercise
than to pay doctors' bills to keep yourself healthy:</p>

  <h5 class='c012'>KEEP YOURSELF CLEAN.</h5>
</div>
<p class='c004'>In the war in South Africa we lost an enormous number
of men dying from disease as well as from wounds. The
Japs, in their war, lost very few from sickness, and a very
small proportion of those who were wounded. What
made the difference? Probably a good many things.
Our men were not so particular as to what water they
drank as the Japs were, and they ate more meat than the
Japs; but, also, they did not keep themselves or their
clothes very clean&mdash;it was often difficult to find water.
The Japs, on the other hand, kept themselves very clean,
with baths every day.</p>

<p class='c005'>If you cut your hand when it is dirty it is very likely
to fester, and to become very sore; but if your hand is
quite clean and freshly washed no harm will come of it, it
heals up at once. It was the same with wounds in the
war; they became very bad in the case of men who had
not kept themselves clean.</p>

<p class='c005'>Cleaning your skin helps to clean your blood. The
Japs say that half the good of exercise is lost if you do
not have a bath immediately after it.</p>

<p class='c005'>It may not be always possible for you to get a bath
every day, but you can at any rate rub yourself over
with a wet towel, or scrub yourself with a dry one, and
you ought not to miss a single day in doing this if you
want to keep fit and well.</p>

<p class='c005'>You should also keep clean in your clothing, both your
underclothing as well as that which shows. Beat it out
with a stick every day before putting it on.</p>

<p class='c005'>And to be healthy and strong you must keep your
blood healthy and clean inside you. This is done by
breathing in lots of pure, fresh air, by deep breathing,
and by clearing out all dirty matter from inside your
stomach, which is done by having a "rear" daily, without
fail; many people are the better for having it twice
a day. If there is any difficulty about it one day, drink
plenty of good water, both morning and evening, and
practise body-twisting exercises, and all should be well.</p>

<p class='c005'>Never start work in the morning without some sort
of food inside you, if it is only a cup of hot water.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>Never bathe in deep water very soon after a meal, it
is very likely to cause cramp, which doubles you up, and
so you get drowned.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>SMOKING.</h5>
<p class='c004'>A scout does not smoke. Any boy can smoke; it is
not such a very wonderful thing to do. But a scout will
not do it because he is not such a fool. He knows that
when a lad smokes before he is fully grown up it is
almost sure to make his heart feeble, and the heart is the
most important organ in a lad's body. It pumps the
blood all over him to form flesh, bone, and muscle. If
the heart does not do its work the body cannot grow to
be healthy. Any scout knows that smoking spoils his
eyesight, and also his sense of smell, which is of greatest
importance to him for scouting on active service.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>Sir William Broadbent, the great doctor, and Professor
Sims Woodhead have both told us what bad
effects tobacco smoking has on the health of boys.
Numerous well-known sportsmen and others in all kinds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>of professions have given up the use of tobacco as they
find they can do better without it. Lord Roberts and
Lord Wolseley as soldiers, Lord Charles Beresford as a
sailor, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the judge, Sir
William Grantham, all do not smoke, nor do Dr. Grace
the cricketer, Mr. Noble and seven of the chief Australian
cricketers, Mr. Eustace Miles the champion tennis
player, Basset the football player, Hanlon the sculler,
Weston the pedestrian, Taylor the golf player, Burnham
the scout, Selous the hunter, and very many other celebrated
men. They are all non-smokers.</p>

<p class='c005'>The railway and post office authorities in America
will not employ boys who smoke. I know one big
employer who not only does not smoke, but will not
employ a boy who does. So with a great many other
employers in Great Britain. In Japan no boy under
twenty is allowed to smoke, and if he does his parents
are taken up and fined.</p>

<p class='c005'>Professor Osler, in speaking against tobacco, said it
would be a good thing if all the beer and spirits in England
could be thrown into the sea one day, and if, on the
second day, you dumped all the tobacco there too it
would be very good for everyone in England&mdash;although
unhealthy for the fish.</p>

<p class='c005'>No boy ever began smoking because he liked it, but
generally because either he feared being chaffed by the
other boys as afraid to smoke, or because he thought
that by smoking he would look like a great man&mdash;when
all the time he only looks like a little ass.</p>

<p class='c005'>So don't funk, but just make up your own mind for
yourself that you don't mean to smoke till you are grown
up; and stick to it. That will show you to be a man
much more than any slobbering about with a half-smoked
cigarette between your lips. The other fellows
will in the end respect you much more, and will probably
in many cases secretly follow your lead. If they
do this you will already have done a good thing in the
world, although you are only a boy. From that small
start you will most probably go on and do big things
as you grow up.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>
  <h5 class='c012'>DRINKING.</h5>
</div>
<p class='c004'>A priest in the East End of London has lately stated
that out of a thousand cases of distress known to him
only two or three were not caused by drink.</p>

<p class='c005'>A soldierly-looking man came up to me one night and
brought out his discharge certificates, showing that he
had served with me in South Africa. He said he could
get no work, and he was starving. Every man's hand
was against him, apparently because he was a soldier.
My nose and eyes told me in a moment another tale, and
that was the real cause of his being in distress.</p>

<p class='c005'>A stale smell of tobacco and beer hung about his
clothes, his finger-tips were yellow with cigarette smoke,
he had even taken some kind of scented lozenge to try
and hide the whisky smell in his breath. No wonder
nobody would employ him, or give him more money to
drink with, for that was all that he would do with money
if he got it.</p>

<p class='c005'>Very much of the poverty and distress in this country
is brought about by men getting into the habit of wasting
their money and time on drink. And a great deal of
crime, and also of illness, and even madness is due to
the same habit of drinking too much. Liquor&mdash;that is
beer or spirits&mdash;is not at all necessary to make a man
strong and well. Quite the contrary. The old saying,
"Strong drink makes weak men," is a very true one.</p>

<p class='c005'>Yet £166,400,000 were spent last year alone on drink
in the United Kingdom&mdash;enough to have made every
family in the country better off by £15 if they had drunk
water. And this £15 would be increased to £22 if the
men gave up tobacco.</p>

<p class='c005'>It would be simply impossible for a man who drinks
to be a scout. Keep off liquor from the very first, and
make up your mind to have nothing to do with it.
Water, tea, or coffee are quite good enough drinks for
quenching your thirst or for picking you up at any time,
or if it is very hot lemonade or a squeeze of lemon
are much better refreshment.</p>

<p class='c005'>A good scout trains himself pretty well to do without
liquid. It is very much a matter of habit. If you keep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>your mouth shut when walking or running, or chew a
pebble (which also makes you keep your mouth shut),
you do not get thirsty like you do when you go along
with your mouth open sucking in the air and dry dust.
But you must also be in good, hard condition. If you
are fat from want of exercise you are sure to get thirsty
and want to drink every mile. If you do not let yourself
drink the thirst wears off after a short time. If you
keep drinking water on the line of march, or while
playing games, it helps to tire you and spoils your
wind.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is often difficult to avoid taking strong drinks when
you meet friends who want to treat you, but they
generally like you all the better if you say you don't
want anything, as then they don't have to pay for it; if
they insist you can take a gingerbeer or something quite
harmless. But it is a stupid fashion when, in order to
prove that you are friends, you have to drink with each
other. Luckily it is dying out now; the best men do
not do it because they know it does them no good.
Wasters like to stand about a bar talking and sipping&mdash;generally
at the other fellow's expense, but they are
wasters, and it is as well to keep out of their company,
if you want to get on and have a good time.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>EARLY RISING.</h5>
<p class='c004'>The scout's time for being most active is in the early
morning, because that is the time when wild animals all
do their feeding and moving about; and also in war the
usual hour for an attack is just before dawn, when the
attackers can creep up unseen in the dark, and get
sufficient light to enable them to carry out the attack
suddenly while the other people are still asleep.</p>

<p class='c005'>So a scout trains himself to the habit of getting up
very early; and when once he is in the habit it is no trouble
at all to him, like it is to some fat fellows who lie asleep
after the daylight has come.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Emperor Charlemagne, who was a great scout in
the old days, used always to get up in the middle of the
night.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>The Duke of Wellington, who, like Napoleon
Bonaparte, preferred to sleep on a little camp bed, used
to say, "When it is time to turn over in bed it is time
to turn out?"</p>

<p class='c005'>Many men who manage to get through more work
than others in a day, do so by getting up an hour or two
earlier. By getting up early you also can get more
time for play.</p>

<p class='c005'>If you get up one hour earlier than other people you
get thirty hours a month more of life than they do;
while they have twelve months in the year you get 365
extra hours, or thirty more days&mdash;that is, thirteen months
to their twelve.</p>

<p class='c005'>The old rhyme has a lot of truth in it when it says,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Early to bed and early to rise,</div>
      <div class='line'>Makes a man healthy, and wealthy, and wise."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h5 class='c012'>SMILE.</h5>
<p class='c004'>Want of laughter means want of health. Laugh as
much as you can: it does you good; so whenever you
can get a good laugh on. And make other people laugh
too, when possible, as it does them good.</p>

<p class='c005'>If you are in pain or trouble make yourself smile at it:
if you remember to do this, and force yourself, you will
find it really does make a great difference.</p>

<p class='c005'>If you read about great scouts like Captain John
Smith, the "Pathfinder," and others, you will generally
find that they were pretty cheery old fellows.</p>

<p class='c005'>The ordinary boy is apt to frown when working hard
at physical exercises, but the boy scout is required to
smile all the time: he drops a mark off his score whenever
he frowns.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>HOW TO KEEP HEALTHY.</h5>
<h5 class='c012'><i>PRACTICES.</i></h5>
<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Deep Breathing.</span>&mdash;Deep breathing is of the greatest
importance for bringing fresh air into the lungs to be
put into the blood, and for developing the size of the
chest, but it should be done carefully, according to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>instructions, and not overdone, otherwise it is liable to
strain the heart. The Japs always carry on deep
breathing exercise for a few minutes when they first get
up in the morning, and always in the open air. It is
done by sucking air in through the nose until it swells
out your ribs as far as possible, especially at the back;
then, after a pause, you breathe out the air slowly and
gradually through the mouth until you have not a scrap
of air left in you, then after a pause draw in your breath
again through the nose as before.</p>

<p class='c005'>Singing, if carried out on a system like that of Mr.
Tomlin's, develops simultaneously proper breathing and
development of heart, lungs, chest, and throat, together
with dramatic feeling in rendering the song.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>For instance, his method of "Hooligan Taming" is to
get a large crowd of wild lads together, and to start
shouting a chorus to piano accompaniment&mdash;say, "Hearts
of Oak." He shouts the suggestion of a story as they
go along with it; how they are marching boldly to
attack a fort which they mean to carry in style for the
glory of themselves and their country, when suddenly
they become aware that the enemy does not know of
their approach, so they must creep and crawl, "in a
whisper," as they stealthily get nearer to the fort. Closer
and closer they come with gradually increasing tone.
Now charge on up the hill, through shot and shell, a
scramble, a rush and a fight, and the fort is theirs. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>there are wounded to be picked up tenderly, and the
dead to be laid out reverently with quiet and measured
song, solemn and soft.</p>

<p class='c005'>And then they pick up their arms again, and with the
prisoners and spoils of war they march gaily away in
triumph, at the full power of their lungs.</p>

for winter evenings, with their quaint music and movements.</p>

<h5 class='c012'>CAMP DOCTORING.</h5>
<p class='c004'>Some years ago, when I was in Kashmir, Northern India,
some natives brought to me a young man on a stretcher
who they said had fallen off a high rock and had broken his
back and was dying. I soon found that he had only
dislocated his shoulder and had got a few bruises, and
seemed to think that he ought to die.</p>

<p class='c005'>So I pulled off my shoe, sat down alongside him
facing his head, put my heel in his arm-pit, got hold of
his arm, and pulled with all my force till the bone jumped
into its socket. The pain made him faint and his friends
thought I really had killed him. But in a few minutes
he recovered and found his arm was all right. Then
they thought I must be no end of a doctor, so they sent
round the country for all the sick to be brought in to be
cured; and I had an awful time of it for the next two
days. Cases of every kind of disease were carried in
and I had scarcely any drugs with which to treat them,
but I did the best I could, and I really believe that some
of the poor creatures got better from simply <i>believing</i>
that I was doing them a lot of good.</p>

<p class='c005'>But most of them were ill from being dirty and letting
their wounds get poisoned with filth; and many were ill
from bad drainage, and from drinking foul water, and so on.</p>

<p class='c005'>This I explained to the headmen of the villages, and
I hope that I did some good for their future health.</p>

<p class='c005'>At any rate, they were most grateful, and gave me a lot
of help ever afterwards in getting good bear-hunting
and in getting food, etc.</p>

<p class='c005'>If I had not known a little doctoring I could have done
nothing for these poor creatures.</p>

  <h5 class='c012'>MICROBES AND HOW TO FIGHT THEM.</h5>
</div>
<p class='c004'>Disease is carried about in the air and in water by tiny
invisible insects called "germs" or "microbes," and you
are very apt to breathe them in through the mouth or to
get them in your drink or food and to swallow them, and
then they breed disease inside you. If your blood is in
really good order it generally does not matter, no harm
results; but if your blood is out of order from weakness or
constipation&mdash;that is, not going regularly to the "rear"&mdash;these
microbes will very probably make you ill. A great
point is, therefore, to abolish the microbes if possible.
They like living in dark, damp, and dirty places. And
they come from bad drains, old dustbins, and rotting
flesh, etc.; in fact, generally where there is a bad smell.
Therefore, keep your room, or your camp, and your
clothes clean, dry, and as sunny as possible and well
aired; and keep away from places that smell badly.
Before your meals you should always wash your hands
and finger-nails, for they are very apt to harbour microbes
which have come from anything that you may have been
handling in the day.</p>

<p class='c005'>You frequently see notices in omnibuses and public
places requesting you not to spit. The reason for this is
that many people spit who have diseased lungs and from
their spittle the microbes of their diseases get in the
air and are breathed by healthy people into their lungs,
and they become also diseased. Often you may have a
disease in you for some years without knowing it and if
you spit you are liable to communicate that disease
to sound people; so you should not do it for their
sake.</p>

<p class='c005'>But you need not be afraid of diseases if you breathe
through your nose and keep your blood in good order.
It is always well on coming out of a crowded theatre,
church or hall, to cough and blow your nose in order to
get rid of microbes which you might have breathed in
from other people in the crowd. One in every thirty of
people that you meet has got the disease of consumption
on him&mdash;and it is very catching. It comes very much
from living in houses where the windows are kept always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>shut up. The best chance of getting cured of it if you
get the disease is to sleep always out of doors.</p>

<p class='c005'>A scout has to sleep a great deal in the open air, therefore
when he is in a house he sleeps with the windows
as wide open as possible, otherwise he feels stuffy; and
also if he gets accustomed to sleeping in warm atmosphere
he would catch cold when he goes into camp, and
nothing could be more ridiculous or more like a tenderfoot
than a scout with a cold in his head. When once
he is accustomed to having his windows open he will
never catch cold in a room.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>FOOD.</h5>
<p class='c004'>A good many illnesses come from over-eating or eating
the wrong kind of food.</p>

<p class='c005'>A scout must know how to take care of himself, else
he is of no use. He must keep himself light and active.
Once he has got the right kind of muscles on he can
remain fit without further special exercising of those
muscles, provided that he eats the right kind of food.</p>

<p class='c005'>Eustace Miles, the tennis and racket champion, does
not go into training before he plays his matches; he
knows he has got his muscles rightly formed, and he
simply lives on plain, light food always, and so is always
fit to play a hard game. He never eats meat.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the siege of Mafeking, when we were put on short
commons, those of the garrison who were accustomed to
eat very little at their meals did not suffer like some
people, who had been accustomed to do themselves well
in peace time; these became weak and irritable. Our
food there towards the end was limited to a hunk of
pounded-up oats, about the size of a penny bun, which
was our whole bread-supply for the day, and about a
pound of meat and two pints of "sowens," a kind of
stuff like bill-stickers' paste that had gone wrong.</p>

<p class='c005'>English people as a rule eat more meat than is necessary,
in fact they could do without it altogether if they
tried, and would be none the worse. It is an expensive
luxury. The Japanese are as strong as us, but they do
not eat any meat, and only eat small meals of other things.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>The cheapest and best foods are Dried Peas, 2d.
per lb; Flour, 1s. 4d. per stone; Oatmeal, 2d. per lb.;
Potatoes, 1/2d. per lb.; Hominy, 1-1/2d. per lb.; Cheese at
6d. per lb. Other good foods are fruit, vegetables, fish,
eggs, nuts, rice, and milk, and one can live on these
perfectly well without meat; bananas are especially
good food, they are cheap, have no seeds nor pips to
irritate your inside, their skin protects them from germs
of disease and their flesh is of a wholesome kind and
satisfying.</p>

<p class='c005'>The natives of the West Coast of Africa eat very little
else all their lives and they are fat and happy.</p>

<p class='c005'>If you have lots of fresh air you do not want much
food, if on the other hand you are sitting indoors all day
much food makes you fat and sleepy, so that in either
case you are better for taking a little; still, growing boys
should not starve themselves but, at the same time, they
need not be like that little hog at the school-feast who,
when asked, "Can't you eat any more?" replied,
"Yes, I could <i>eat</i> more, but I've no room to <i>swallow</i> it."</p>

<p class='c005'>A great cause of illness nowadays is the amount of
medicine which fellows dose themselves with when
there is no reason for taking any medicine at all. The
best medicine is open-air and exercise and a big cup of
water in the early morning if you are constipated, and a
pint of hot water on going to bed.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>CLOTHING.</h5>
<p class='c004'>A scout's clothing should be of flannel or wool as much
as possible, because it dries easily. Cotton next the skin
is not good unless you change it directly it gets wet&mdash;it
is so likely to give you a chill, and a scout is no use if
he gets laid up.</p>

<p class='c005'>One great point that a scout should take care about, to
ensure his endurance and being able to go on the march
for a long time, is his boots.</p>

<p class='c005'>A scout who gets sore feet with much walking becomes
useless.</p>

<p class='c005'>You should therefore take great care to have good,
well-fitting, roomy boots, and fairly stout ones, and as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>like the natural shape of your bare feet as possible with
a straighter edge on the inside than bootmakers usually
give to the swagger boot. Scouts have no use for
swagger boots.</p>

<p class='c005'>The feet should be kept as dry as possible; if they
are allowed to get wet the skin is softened and very soon
gets blistered and rubbed raw where there is a little
pressure of the boot.</p>

<p class='c005'>Of course they get wet from perspiration as well as
from outside wet. Therefore to dry this it is necessary
to wear good woollen socks.</p>

<p class='c005'>If a man wears thin cotton or silk socks you can tell
at once that he is no walker. A fellow who goes out to
a Colony for the first time is called a "Tender-foot"
because he generally gets sore feet until by experience
he learns how to keep his feet in good order. It is a
good thing to soap or grease your feet and the inside of
your socks before putting them on.</p>

<p class='c005'>If your feet always perspire a good deal it is a useful
thing to powder them with powder made of boric acid,
starch, and oxide of zinc in equal parts. This powder
should be rubbed in between the toes so as to prevent
soft corns forming there. Your feet can be hardened to
some extent by soaking them in alum and water, or salt
and water.</p>

<p class='c005'>Keep your boots soft with lots of grease, mutton fat,
dubbin, or castor oil&mdash;especially when they have got
wet from rain, etc. Wash the feet every day.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>PRACTICES.</h5>
<h5 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Drill.</span></h5>
<p class='c004'>Scouts have to drill to enable them to be moved quickly
from one point to another in good order. Drill also sets
them up, and makes them smart and quick.</p>

<p class='c005'>It strengthens the muscles which support the body and
by keeping the body upright the lungs and heart get
plenty of room to work, and the inside organs are kept
on the proper position for proper digestion of food and
so on.</p>

<p class='c005'>A slouching position on the other hand depresses all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>the other organs and prevents them doing their work
properly, so that a man in that position is generally weak
and often ill.</p>

<p class='c005'>Growing lads are very apt to slouch and should therefore
do all they can to get out of the habit by plenty of
physical exercises and drill.</p>

<p class='c005'>Stand upright when you are standing and when you
are sitting down sit upright with your back well into the
back part of the chair. Alertness of the body whether you
are moving, standing, or sitting means alertness of mind
and it is a paying thing to have because many an employer
will select an alert-looking boy for work and pass over
a sloucher. When you have to stoop over writing at a
table or even tying a boot-lace do not round your back
but tuck in the small of your back which thus helps to
strengthen your body.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Drill.</span>&mdash;On the word "Alert" the scout stands
upright with both feet together, hands hanging naturally
at the sides, fingers straight, and looking straight to his
front.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the word "Easy" he carries the right foot away
six inches to the right, and clasps his hands behind his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>back, and can turn his head about. At the word "Sit
Easy" he squats down on the ground in any position he
likes. "Sit Easy" should usually be given whenever you
don't want the boys to be at the "Alert," provided that
the ground is dry.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the command "Quick March," boys move off with
the left foot leading, at a smart pace, swinging the arms
freely, as this gives good exercise to the body and muscles
and interior organs.</p>

with short sharp steps, hands swinging loosely, not
tucked up at the side.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the command "Scout Pace" the boys march at
the quick march for fifty paces then double fifty paces,
and so on alternately running and walking, until the
word is given "Quick March" or "Halt."</p>

<p class='c005'>"Follow Your Leader." "Leader Right Turn"&mdash;the

both hands as high as possible over the head, and link
fingers, lean backwards, then sway the arms very slowly
round in the direction of a cone so that the hands make a
wide circle above and round the body, the body turning
from the hips, and leaning over to one side then to the
front, then to the other side and then back; this is to
exercise the muscles of the waist and stomach, and should
be repeated say six times to either hand. With the
eyes you should be trying to see all that goes on behind
you during the movement.</p>

</div>
<h4 class='c012'>HINTS TO INSTRUCTORS.</h4>
<p class='c004'><i>One aim of the Boy Scouts scheme is to revive
amongst us, if possible, some of the rules of the knights
of old, which did so much for the moral tone of our
race, just as the Bushido of the ancient Samurai
Knights has done, and is still doing, for Japan.
Unfortunately, chivalry with us has, to a large
extent, been allowed to die out, whereas in Japan it
is taught to the children, so that it becomes with them
a practice of their life, and it is also taught to children
in Germany and Switzerland with the best results.
Our effort is not so much to discipline the boys, as to
teach them to discipline themselves.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>It is impossible in so short a space as I have at my
disposal to do more than touch upon subjects which
the instructor may elaborate for himself. The different
qualities which the Knight's Code demanded are here
grouped under the three heads</i>:</p>

</div>
<h4 class='c012'>CAMP FIRE YARN.&mdash;No. 20. <br /> CHIVALRY TO OTHERS.</h4>
<p class='c004'>Knights Errant&mdash;Helpfulness to Others&mdash;Courtesy
to Women.</p>
<p class='c004'>"In days of old, when knights were bold" it must have
been a fine sight to see one of these steel-clad horsemen
come riding through the dark green woods in his shining
armour, with shield and lance and waving plumes, bestriding
his gallant war-horse, strong to bear its load,
and full of fire to charge upon an enemy. And near
him rode his squire, a young man, his assistant and
companion, who would some day become a knight.</p>

<p class='c005'>Behind him rode his group, or patrol of men-at-arms&mdash;stout,
hearty warriors, ready to follow their knight to
the gates of death if need be. They were the tough
yeomen of the old days, who won so many of her fine
fights for Britain through their pluck and loyal devotion
to their knights.</p>

<p class='c005'>In peace time, when there was no fighting to be done,
the knight would daily ride about looking for a chance
of doing a good turn to any wanting help, especially
woman or child who might be in distress. When
engaged in thus doing good turns he was called a
"Knight Errant." His patrol naturally acted in the
same way as their leader, and a man-at-arms was always
equally ready to help the distressed with his strong
right arm. The knights of old were the patrol leaders
of the nation, and the men-at-arms were the scouts.</p>

<p class='c005'>You patrol leaders and scouts are therefore very like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>the knights and their retainers, especially if you keep
your honour ever before you in the first place and do
your best to help other people who are in trouble or who
want assistance. Your motto is, "Be Prepared" to do
this, and the motto of the knights was a similar one,
"Be Always Ready."</p>

<p class='c005'>Chivalry&mdash;that is, the order of the knights&mdash;was
started in England some 1500 years ago by King
Arthur.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the death of his father, King Uther Pendragon, he
was living with his uncle, and nobody knew who was to
be King. He did not himself know that he was son of
the late King.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then a great stone was found in the churchyard, into
which a sword was sticking, and on the stone was
written:</p>

<p class='c005'>"Whosoever pulleth this sword out of this stone is
the rightwise King born of all England."</p>

<p class='c005'>All the chief lords had a try at pulling it out, but none
could move it.</p>

<p class='c005'>That day there was a tournament at which Arthur's
cousin was to fight, but when he got to the ground he
found he had left his sword at home, and he sent Arthur
to fetch it. Arthur could not find it, but remembering
the sword in the churchyard he went there and pulled at
it, and it came out of the stone at once; and he took it
to his cousin. After the sports he put it back again into
the stone; and again they all tried to pull it out, but
could not move it, but when he tried he drew it out
quite easily. So he was proclaimed King.</p>

<p class='c005'>He afterwards got together a number of knights, and
used to sit with them at a great round table, and so
they were called the "Knights of the Round Table."
The table is still to be seen at Winchester.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>ST. GEORGE.</h5>
<p class='c004'>They had as their patron saint St. George, because
he was the only one of all the saints who was a horseman.
He is the patron saint of cavalry and scouts all
over Europe.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>St. George is the special saint of England. The
battle-cry of the knights used to be, "For Saint George
and Merrie England!"</p>

<p class='c005'>St. George's Day is 23rd April, and on that day all
good scouts wear a rose in his honour and fly their flags.
Don't forget it on the next 23rd April.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>THE KNIGHTS' CODE.</h5>
<p class='c004'>The laws of the knights were these:</p>

<p class='c009'>"<i>Be Always Ready</i>, with your armour on, except when
you are taking your rest at night.</p>

<p class='c010'>Defend the poor, and help them that cannot defend
themselves.</p>

<p class='c010'>Do nothing to hurt or offend anyone else.</p>

<p class='c010'>Be prepared to fight in the defence of England.</p>

<p class='c010'>At whatever you are working try and win honour and
a name for honesty.</p>

<p class='c010'>Never break your promise.</p>

<p class='c010'>Maintain the honour of your country with your life.</p>

<p class='c010'>Rather die honest than live shamelessly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Chivalry requireth that youth should be trained to
perform the most laborious and humble offices with
<i>cheerfulness</i> and grace; and to do good unto
others."</p>

<p class='c007'>These are the first rules with which the old knights
started, and from which the scout laws of to-day come.</p>

<p class='c005'>A knight (or scout) is at all times a gentleman. So
many people seem to think that a gentleman must have
lots of money. That does not make a gentleman. A
gentleman is anyone who carries out the rules of chivalry
of the knights.</p>

<p class='c005'>A London policeman, for instance, is a gentleman, because
he is well disciplined, loyal, polite, brave, good-tempered,
and helpful to women and children.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>UNSELFISHNESS.</h5>
<p class='c004'>Captain John Smith, the old English adventurer of
three hundred years ago, was a pretty tough customer
to deal with, as he had fought in every part of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>the world and had been wounded over and over again;
but he also had a good, kind heart within him. He
was as good a type of scout as you could find anywhere.
One of his favourite expressions was, "We
were born, not for ourselves, but to do good to others,"
and he carried this out very much in his life, for he was
the most unselfish of men.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>SELF-SACRIFICE.</h5>
<p class='c004'>King Richard I., who was one of the first of the
Scouts of the Empire, left his kingdom, his family, and
everything to go and fight against the enemies of the
Christian religion, and very nearly lost his kingdom by
doing so, for he was absent for some years, and in the
meantime his brother tried to usurp his place. On his
way home from the wars in Palestine he was caught by
the King of Austria, and was put by him in prison,
where he lingered for twelve months. He was discovered
by his minstrel, Blondel, who knowing that he must have
been captured somewhere went about Europe singing his
favourite songs outside the prisons until he was answered
from inside; and so he found him and procured his
release.</p>

<p class='c005'>(See "The Talisman," by Sir Walter Scott.)</p>

<p class='c005'>But self-sacrifice is also to be found among us to-day.
Only the other day a lad of eighteen named Currie saw a
little girl playing on the railway line at Clydebank in
front of an approaching train. He tried to rescue her,
but he was lame from an injury he had got at football, and
it delayed him in getting her clear. The train knocked
both of them over, and both were killed.</p>

<p class='c005'>But Currie's gallant attempt is an example of chivalry
for scouts to follow. It was sacrifice of himself in the
attempt to save a child.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>KINDNESS.</h5>
<p class='c004'>"Kindness and gentleness are great virtues," says an
old Spanish proverb, and another says, "Oblige without
regarding whom you oblige," which means be kind to
anyone, great or small, rich or poor.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>The great point about a knight was that he was always
doing kindnesses or good turns to people. His idea was
that everyone must die, but you should make up your
mind that before your time comes you will do something
good. Therefore, do it at once, for you never know when
you may be going off.</p>

<p class='c005'>So, with the scouts, it has been made one of our laws that
we do a good turn to somebody every day. It does not
matter how small that good turn may be, if it were only
to help an old woman lift her bundle, or to guide a
child across a crowded street, or to put a halfpenny in
the poor-box. Something good ought to be done each
day of your life, and you should start to-day to carry out
this rule, and never forget it during the remaining days
of your life. Remember the knot in your necktie and
on your scout's badge&mdash;they are reminders to you
to do a good turn. And do your good turn not
only to your friends, but to strangers and even to your
enemies.</p>

<p class='c005'>When the Russians were besieged in Port Arthur by
the Japanese in 1905, the Japs got close up to their forts
by digging long, deep trenches, into which the Russians
were not able to shoot. On one occasion they were so
close that a Russian soldier was able to throw a letter
into the Japanese trench. In this letter he said that he
wanted to send a message to his mother in Russia, as
she was very anxious about him; but as Port Arthur
was now cut off from all communication he begged that
the Japs would send the message for him; and he inclosed
a note for his mother and a gold coin to pay the
cost.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Japanese soldier who found the note, instead
of tearing up the letter and keeping the money, did what
every scout would do, took it to his officer, and the
officer telegraphed the Russian's message to his mother,
and threw a note back into the enemy's fort to tell him
that he had done so.</p>

<p class='c005'>This, with other instances of chivalry on both sides, is
described in Mr. Richmond Smith's book, "The Siege
and Fall of Port Arthur."</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>
  <h5 class='c012'>GENEROSITY.</h5>
</div>
<p class='c004'>Some people are fond of hoarding up their money and
never spending it. It is well to be thrifty, but it is
also well to give away money where it is wanted;
in fact, that is part of the object of saving up your
money. In being charitable, be careful that you do not
fall into the mistake of false charity. That is to say,
it is very easy and comforting to you to give a penny to
a poor beggar in the street, but you ought not to do it.
That poor beggar is ninety-nine times out of a hundred
an arrant old fraud, and by giving your penny you are
encouraging him and others to go on with that trade.
There may be, probably are, hundreds of really poor
and miserable people hiding away, whom you never
see and to whom that penny would be a godsend.
The Charity Organisation Society knows where they
are, and which they are, and if you give your penny to
them, they will put it into the right hands for you.</p>

<p class='c005'>You need not be rich in order to be charitable. Many
of the knights were poor men. At one time some of
them wore as their crest two knights riding on one
horse, which meant that they were too poor to afford a
horse apiece.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>TIPS.</h5>
<p class='c004'>Then "tips" are a very bad thing.</p>

<p class='c005'>Wherever you go, people want to be tipped for doing
the slightest thing which they ought to do out of common
good feeling. A scout will never accept a tip, even if it
is offered him. It is often difficult to refuse, but for a
scout it is easy. He has only to say, "Thank you very
much, but I am a scout, and our rules don't allow us to
accept anything for doing a good turn."</p>

<p class='c005'>"Tips" put you on a wrong footing with everyone.</p>

<p class='c005'>You cannot work in a friendly way with a man if you
are thinking how much "tip" you are going to get out of
him, or he is thinking how much he'll have to "tip" you.
And all scouts' work for another ought to be done in a
friendly way.</p>

<p class='c005'>Of course, proper pay that is earned by your work is
another thing, and you will be right to accept it.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>
  <h5 class='c012'>FRIENDLINESS.</h5>
</div>
<p class='c004'>The great difference in a Colonial bushman and a stay-at-home
Briton is that the Colonial is in shirt-sleeves
while the other is buttoned up in his coat, and their
characters are much the same. The Colonial is open
and cheery with everybody at once, while the Briton
is rather inclined to shut himself up from his neighbours
inside his coat, and takes a deal of drawing out
before he becomes friendly. The free, open-air, shirt-sleeve
habits of the Colonial do away with this, and life
becomes much more pleasant to everybody all round. A
boy scout should remember that he is like the Colonial,
and, like Kim, the "friend of all the world."</p>

<p class='c005'>But don't let your friendliness lead you into that
foolery that is too common in England, namely, throwing
away your hard-earned savings in "standing treat" to
your friends.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>POLITENESS.</h5>
<p class='c004'>One of the stories that the knights used to tell as an
example of politeness was that Julius Cæsar, when he
was entertained to supper by a poor peasant, was so
polite that when the man gave him a dish of pickles
to eat, thinking they were the sort of vegetables that a
high-born officer would like, Cæsar ate the whole dish,
and pretended to like them, although they burnt his
mouth and disagreed with him considerably.</p>

<p class='c005'>In Spain you ask a man the way&mdash;he does not merely
point it out, but takes off his hat, bows, and says that it
will be a great pleasure to him to show it, and walks
with you till he has set you properly upon it. He will
take no reward.</p>

<p class='c005'>A Frenchman will take off his hat when he addresses
a stranger, as you may often see him do in London,
even when he asks a policeman the way.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Dutch fishermen, big and brawny as they are,
take up the whole street when walking down it; but
when a stranger comes along they stand to one side,
and smilingly take off their caps to let him pass.</p>

<p class='c005'>A lady told me that when in one of the far west
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>Canadian townships she met a group of wild-looking
cowboys walking down the street, she felt quite alarmed.
But as they got near they stood to one side, and took off
their hats with the greatest respect, and made way for
her.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>COURTESY TO WOMEN.</h5>
<p class='c004'>The knights of old were particularly attentive in respect
and courtesy to women.</p>

<p class='c005'>Sir Nigel Loring in "The White Company" is a type
of a chivalrous knight of the old times. Although very
small, and half blind by reason of some lime which an
enemy had thrown in his eyes early in his career, he
was an exceedingly brave man, and at the same time
very humble, and very helpful to others.</p>

<p class='c005'>But above all things he reverenced women. He had
a big, plain lady as his wife, but he always upheld her
beauty and virtue, and was ready to fight anybody who
doubted him.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then with poor women, old or young, he was always
courteous and helpful. And that is how a scout should act.</p>

<p class='c005'>King Arthur, who made the rules of chivalry, was himself
chivalrous to women of whatever class.</p>

<p class='c005'>One day a girl rushed into his hall crying for help.
Her hair was streaming and smeared with mud, her arms
were torn with brambles, and she was dressed in rags.
She had been ill-treated by a band of robbers who roved
the country, doing all the harm they could. When he
heard her tale King Arthur sprang on to his horse and
rode off himself to the robbers' cave, and even at the
risk of his own life he fought and defeated them, so that
they could no more trouble his people.</p>

<p class='c005'>When walking with a lady or a child, a scout should
always have her on his left side, so that his right is free
to protect her.</p>

<p class='c005'>This rule is altered when walking in the streets: then
a man will walk on the side of her nearest to the traffic,
to protect her against accident, or mud-splashes, etc.</p>

<p class='c005'>In meeting a woman or a child, a man should, as a
matter of course, always make way for her, even if he
has to step off the pavement into the mud.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>So also in riding in a crowded tram or railway
carriage no man worthy of the name will allow a woman
or a child to stand up if he has a seat. He will at once
give it up to the woman and stand himself. As a
scout, you should set an example in this by being the
first man in the carriage to do it. And in doing so, do
it cheerfully, with a smile, so that she may not think you
are annoyed at having to do it.</p>

<p class='c005'>When in the street always be on the look out to help
women and children. A good opportunity is when they
want to cross a street, or to find the way, or to call a
cab or 'bus. If you see them, go and help them at once&mdash;and
don't accept any reward.</p>

<p class='c005'>The other day I saw a boy help a lady out of a
carriage, and as he shut the door after her, she turned to
give him some money, but he touched his cap, and
smilingly said, "No, thank you, Marm; it's my duty,"
and walked off. So I shook hands with him, for I felt
that although he had not been taught, he was a scout by
nature.</p>

<p class='c005'>This is the kind of courtesy one wants to see more
amongst boys of to-day. Only the other day in London, a
girl who had been robbed ran after a thief and pursued
him till he dashed down into a narrow alley, where she
could not follow, but she waited for him; so did the
crowd. And when he came out again, she collared him
and struggled to prevent him escaping; but not one of
the crowd would help her, although there were men and
boys present there. They must have been a poor lot
not to help a girl!</p>

<p class='c005'>Of course, in accidents men and boys will always see
that the women and children are safely got out of
danger, before they think of going themselves. In two
wrecks which occurred in 1906 on the south coast of
England, viz., the <i>Jebba</i>, and the <i>Suevic</i>, it was
very noticeable how carefully arrangements were made
for saving the women and children and old people, before
any idea was given as to how the men were to be rescued.
You should carry your courtesy on with ladies at all
times. If you are sitting down and a lady comes into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>the room, stand up, and see if you can help her in any
way before you sit down.</p>

<p class='c005'>Don't lark about with a girl whom you would not like
your mother or sister to see you with.</p>

<p class='c005'>Don't make love to any girl unless you mean to marry her.</p>

<p class='c005'>Don't marry a girl unless you are in a position to
support her, and to support some children.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>PRACTICES.</h5>
<p class='c004'>Other ways of doing good turns, are such small things
as these: sprinkle sand on a frozen road where horses
are liable to slip; remove orange or banana skins from
the pavement, as they are apt to throw people down;
don't leave gates open, and don't injure fences or walk
over crops in the country; help old people in drawing
water or carrying fuel, etc., to their homes; help to keep
the streets clean by removing scraps of paper.</p>

<h5 class='c012'><i>HOW TO PRACTISE CHIVALRY.</i></h5>
<p class='c004'><i>Make each scout tie a knot in his necktie every
morning as a reminder to carry out his idea of doing a
good turn every day, till it becomes a habit with him.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>Take your boys to an armoury, such as the Tower of
London or South Kensington Museum, and explain to
them the armour and weapons of the knights.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>Make a scout bring in a boy, who is a total stranger,
as his guest for the evening to play in club games, and
hear camp yarns, etc.</i></p>
<h5 class='c012'>GAMES.</h5>
<p class='c004'>"<span class='sc'>Knight Errantry.</span>"&mdash;Scouts go out singly, or in
pairs, or as a patrol. If in a town, to find women or
children in want of help, and to return and report, on
their honour, what they have done. If in the country
call at any farms or cottages and ask to do odd jobs&mdash;for
nothing. The same can be made into a race called a
"Good Turn" race.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Lycurgus said that the wealth of a state lay not so
much in money as in men who were sound in body and
mind, with a body fit for toil and endurance, and with
a mind well disciplined, and seeing things in their
proper proportions.</i></p>
<h5 class='c012'>HONOUR.</h5>
<p class='c004'>The true knight placed his honour before all things. It
was sacred, and he will never do a dishonourable action,
such as telling an untruth or deceiving his superiors or
employers. A man who is honourable is always to be
trusted, and always commands the respect of his fellow
men. His honour guides him in everything that he does.
A captain sticks to the ship till the last, in every wreck
that was ever heard of. Why? She is only a lump of
iron and wood; his life is as valuable as that of any of
the women and children on board, but he makes everybody
get away safely before he attempts to save his
more valuable life. Why? Because the ship is his ship,
and he has been taught that it is his duty to stick to it,
and he considers it would be dishonourable in him to do
otherwise; so he puts honour before safety. So also a
scout should value his honour most of anything.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span><span class='sc'>Fair Play.</span>&mdash;Britons, above all other people, insist
on fair play.</p>

<p class='c005'>If you see a big bully going for a small or weak boy,
you stop him because it is not "fair play."</p>

<p class='c005'>And if a man, in fighting another, knocks him down,
he must not hit or kick him while he is down; everybody
would think him an awful beast if he did. Yet there is
no law about it; you could not get him imprisoned for
it. The truth is that "fair play" is an old idea of
Chivalry that has come down to us from the knights of
old, and we must always keep up that idea.</p>

<p class='c005'>Other nations are not all so good.</p>

<p class='c005'>Often we hear of wounded men being again shot and
killed in battle when they are lying helpless on the
ground. In the South African War, when Major
MacLaren, now our Manager in the Boy Scouts, was
lying helpless, with his thigh broken by a bullet and his
horse shot on top of him, a Boer came up and finding
him alive, fired two more shots into him. Luckily he
recovered and is alive to-day. But that Boer had no
Chivalry in him.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Honesty.</span>&mdash;Honesty is a form of Honour. An
honourable man can be trusted with any amount of
money or other valuables with the certainty that he will
not steal it.</p>

<p class='c005'>Cheating at any time is a sneaking, underhand thing
to do.</p>

<p class='c005'>When you feel inclined to cheat in order to win a
game, or feel very distressed when a game in which
you are playing is going against you, just say to yourself,
"After all, it is only a game. It won't kill me if I do
lose. One can't win always, though I will stick to it in
case of a chance coming."</p>

<p class='c005'>If you keep your head in this way, you will very often
find that you win after all from not being over-anxious or
despairing.</p>

<p class='c005'>And don't forget, whenever you <i>do</i> lose a game, if you
are a true scout, you will at once cheer the winning
team or shake hands with and congratulate the fellow
who has beaten you.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>This rule will be carried out in <i>all</i> games and competitions
among Boy Scouts.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Loyalty.</span>&mdash;Loyalty was, above all, one of the
distinguishing points about the knights. They were
always devotedly loyal to their King and to their country,
and were always ready and eager to die in their defence.
In the same way a follower of the Knights should be
loyal not only to the King but also to everyone who
is above him, whether his officers or employers, and he
should stick to them through thick and thin as part of
his duty.</p>

<p class='c005'>He should also be equally loyal to his own friends and
should support them in evil times as well as in good
times.</p>

<p class='c005'>Loyalty to duty was shown by the Roman soldier of
old who stuck to his post when the city of Pompeii was
overwhelmed with ashes and lava from the volcano
Vesuvius. His remains are still there, with his hand
covering his mouth and nose to prevent the suffocation
which in the end overcame him.</p>

<p class='c005'>His example was followed at some manoeuvres not
long ago by a cadet of Reigate Grammar School who when
posted as sentry was accidentally left on his post when
the field day was over. But though night came on and
it was very cold&mdash;in November last&mdash;the lad stuck to
his post till he was found in the middle of the night,
half-perished with cold, but alive and alert.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>OBEDIENCE AND DISCIPLINE.</h5>
<p class='c004'>Discipline and obedience are as important as bravery
for scouts and for soldiers.</p>

<p class='c005'>The <i>Birkenhead</i> was a transport-ship carrying
troops. She had on board 630 soldiers with their
families and 130 seamen. Near the Cape of Good
Hope one night, she ran on to some rocks, and began to
break up. The soldiers were at once paraded on deck.
Some were told off to get out the boats, and to put the
women and children into them, and others were told off
to get the horses up out of the hold, and to lower them
overboard into the sea in order that they might have a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>chance of swimming ashore. When this had all been
done it was found that there were not enough boats to
take the men, and so the men were ordered to remain in
their ranks. Then the ship broke in half and began to
go down. The Captain shouted to the men to jump
over and save themselves, but the Colonel, Colonel
Seaton, said "No, keep your ranks." For he saw that
if they swam to the boats and tried to get in they would
probably sink them too. So the men kept their ranks
and as the ship rolled over and sank they gave a cheer
and went down with her. Out of the whole 760 on
board, only 192 were saved, but even those would
probably have been lost had it not been for the
discipline and self-sacrifice of the others.</p>

<p class='c005'>Last year a British Training Ship, the <i>Fort Jackson</i>,
full of boy-sailors was run into by a steamer, but just as
on the <i>Birkenhead</i> there was no panic or crying out.
The boys fell in quickly on parade, put on their lifebelts,
and faced the danger calmly and well. And not a life
was lost.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Discipline.</span>&mdash;Gibraltar is a great big fortified rock
which belongs to England, down on the South Coast
of Spain. One hundred and twenty years ago it was
besieged by the Spanish and French armies together.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Spanish Army attacked Gibraltar on the land side,
while the French attacked it by sea, but though they
fought hard and with greatest endurance for over three
years, the British troops defending the place were a
match for them and held out successfully until they were
relieved by the Fleet from home.</p>

<p class='c005'>General Elliot, who had been a Cavalry officer in the
15th Hussars, commanded the troops at Gibraltar, and it
was largely owing to his strict discipline that the
Garrison succeeded in holding out. Every man had
learnt to obey orders without any hesitation or question.</p>

<p class='c005'>One day a man disobeyed an order, so General Elliot
had him up before him and explained that for a man to
be insubordinate at such a time showed that he could not
be in his right senses; he must be mad. So he ordered
that his head should be shaved and that he should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>blistered, bled, and put into a strait-waistcoat and should
be put in the cells, with bread and water, as a lunatic,
and should also be prayed for in church!</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Humility.</span>&mdash;Humility or being humble was one of the
things which was practised by the knights, that is to say
that, although they were generally superior to other
people in fighting or campaigning, they never allowed
themselves to swagger about it. So Don't Swagger.</p>

<p class='c005'>And don't imagine that you have got rights in this
world except those that you earn for yourself. You've
got the right to be believed if you earn it by
always telling the truth, and you've got the right to go to
prison if you earn it by thieving; but there are lots of
men who go about howling about their rights who have
never done anything to earn any rights. Do your duty
first and you will get your rights afterwards.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Fortitude.</span>&mdash;Then the knights were men who never
said "Die" till they were dead; they were always ready
to stick it out till the last extremity, but it is a very
common fault with men to give in to trouble or fear
long before there is any necessity. They often give
up working because they don't get success all at once,
and probably if they stuck to it a little longer, success
would come. A man must expect hard work and want
of success at first.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>COURAGE.</h5>
<p class='c004'>Very few men are born brave, but any man can make
himself brave if he tries&mdash;and especially if he begins
trying when he is a boy.</p>

<p class='c005'>The brave man dashes into danger without any
hesitation, when a less brave man is inclined to hang
back. It is very like bathing. A lot of boys will come
to a river to bathe, and will cower shivering on the bank,
wondering how deep the water is, and whether it is very
cold&mdash;but the brave one will run through them and take
his header into the water, and will be swimming about
happily a few seconds later.</p>

<p class='c005'>The thing is, when there is danger before you, don't
stop and look at it&mdash;the more you look at it the less you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>will like it&mdash;but take the plunge, go boldly in at it, and it
won't be half so bad as it looked, when you are once in
it.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the late war between Japan and Russia some
Japanese pioneers had been ordered to blow up the gate
of a Russian fort so that the attackers could get in.
After nearly all of them had been shot down, a few of
them managed to get to the gate with their charges of
powder. These had to be "tamped" or jammed
tight against the door somehow, and then fired.
The Japs "tamped" them by pushing them against the
door with their chests; they then lit their matches, fired
the charge, and blew up the gates, but blew up themselves
in doing so. But their plucky self-sacrifice
enabled their comrades to get in and win the place for
the Emperor.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>GOOD TEMPER AND CHEERINESS.</h5>
<p class='c004'>The knights laid great stress on being never out of
temper. They thought it bad form to lose their temper,
and to show anger. Captain John Smith, of whom I
spoke just now, was himself a type of a cheerful man.
In fact, towards the end of his life two boys (and he was
very fond of boys) to whom he told his adventures, wrote
them down in a book, but they said that they found
great difficulty in hearing all that he said, because he
roared with laughter so over his own descriptions of his
troubles. But it is very certain, that had he not been a
cheery man, he never could have got through half the
dangers with which he was faced at different times in
his career.</p>

<p class='c005'>Over and over again he was made prisoner by his
enemies&mdash;sometimes savage enemies&mdash;but he managed
always to captivate them with his pleasant manner and
become friends with them, so that often they let him go,
or did not trouble to catch him when he made his
escape.</p>

<p class='c005'>If you do your work cheerfully, your work becomes
much more of a pleasure to you, and also if you are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>cheerful it makes other people cheerful as well, which is
part of your duty as a scout. Mr. J. M. Barrie writes:
"Those who bring sunshine to the lives of others,
cannot keep happiness from themselves," which means, if
you make other people happy, you make yourself
happy.</p>

<p class='c005'>If you are in the habit of taking things cheerfully, you
will very seldom find yourself in serious trouble, because
if a difficulty or annoyance or danger seems very great,
you will, if you are wise, force yourself to laugh at it,
although I will allow it is very difficult to do so at first.
Still, the moment you do laugh, most of the difficulty
seems to disappear at once, and you can tackle it quite
easily.</p>

<p class='c005'>Good temper can be attained by a boy who wants to
have it, and it will help him in every game under the sun,
and more especially in difficulty and danger, and will
often keep him in a situation where a short-tempered
fellow gets turned out, or leaves in a huff.</p>

<p class='c005'>Bad language and swearing are generally used, like
smoking, by boys who want to try and show off how
manly they are, but it only makes them look like fools.
Generally, a man who swears is a man easily upset, and
loses his head in a difficult situation, and he is not, therefore,
to be depended upon. You want to be quite
undisturbed under the greatest difficulties; and so when
you find yourself particularly anxious or excited, or
angry, don't swear, force yourself to smile, and it will set
you right in a moment.</p>

<p class='c005'>Captain John Smith, who neither smoked nor swore,
had a way of dealing with swearers, which is also
adopted by our scouts. He says in his diary that when
his men were cutting down trees, the axes blistered their
tender fingers, so that at about every third blow, a loud
oath would drown the echo of the axe. To remedy this
he devised a plan of having every man's oath noted
down, and at night, for every oath, he had a can of water
poured down the swearer's sleeve, "with which an
offender was so washed, that a man would scarce hear
an oath in a week."</p>

commencement of manhood without any knowledge of a
trade to go on with, and unable to turn their hand to
any work out of their one immediate line. They are
helpless and unemployable. It is here that as
instructor you can do invaluable work for the boy, by

himself for it. Encourage him to take up

  <h5 class='c012'>DUTY TO GOD.</h5>
</div>
<p class='c004'>An old British chieftain, some thirteen hundred years
ago, said:</p>

<p class='c009'>Our life has always seemed to me like the flight of a sparrow
through the great hall, when one is sitting at meals with the log-fire
blazing on the hearth, and all is storm and darkness outside. He
comes in, no one knows from where, and hovers for a short time in
the warmth and light, and then flies forth again into the darkness.
And so it is with the life of a man; he comes no one knows
from where; he is here in the world for a short time till he flies
forth again, no one knows whither. But now you show us that if
we do our duty during our life we shall not fly out into darkness
again when life is ended, since Christ has opened a door for us to
enter a brighter room, a Heaven where we can go and dwell in
peace for ever.</p>

<p class='c007'>This old chief was speaking for all the chiefs of
northern England when King Edwin had introduced to
them a knowledge of the Christian religion; and they
adopted it then and there as one more comforting to
them than their old Pagan worship of heathen gods;
and ever since those days the Christian religion has
been the one to rule our country.</p>

<p class='c005'>Religion is a very simple thing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1st. To believe in God.</div>
      <div class='line'>2nd. To do good to other people.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The old knights, who were the scouts of the nation,
were very religious. They were always careful to attend
church or chapel, especially before going into battle or
undertaking any serious difficulty. They considered it
was the right thing always to Be Prepared for death. In
the great church of Malta you can see to-day where the
old knights used to pray, and they all stood up and drew
their swords during the reading of the Creed, as a sign
that they were prepared to defend the gospel with their
swords and lives. Besides worshipping God in church,
the knights always recognised His work in the things
which He made, such as animals, plants, and scenery.
And so it is with peace scouts to-day that wherever they
go they love the woodlands, the mountains, and the
prairies, and they like to watch and know about the
animals that inhabit them and the wonders of the flowers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>and plants. No man is much good unless he believes in
God and obeys His laws. So every scout should have a
religion.</p>

<p class='c005'>There are many kinds of religion such as Roman
Catholics, Protestants, Jews, Mohammedans, and so on,
but the main point about them is that they all worship
God, although in different ways. They are like an army
which serves one king, though it is divided into different
branches, such as cavalry, artillery, and infantry, and
these wear different uniforms. So, when you meet a
boy of a different religion from your own, you should not
be hostile to him, but recognise that he is like a soldier
in your own army, though in a different uniform, and still
serving the same king as you.</p>

<p class='c005'>In doing your duty to God, always be grateful to Him.
Whenever you enjoy a pleasure or a good game, or
succeed in doing a good thing, thank Him for it, if only
with a word or two, just as you say grace after a meal.
And it is a good thing to bless other people. For
instance, if you see a train starting off, just pray for
God's blessing on all that are in the train and so on.</p>

<p class='c005'>In doing your duty towards man, be helpful and
generous and also always be grateful for any kindness
done to you, and be careful to show that you are grateful.</p>

<p class='c005'>Remember that a present given to you is not yours
until you have thanked for it. While you are the sparrow
flying through the Hall, that is to say, while you are
living your life on this earth, try and do something good
which may remain after you. One writer says:</p>

<p class='c009'>I often think that when the sun goes down the world is hidden
by a big blanket from the light of Heaven, but the stars are little
holes pierced in that blanket by those who have done good deeds in
this world. The stars are not all the same size; some are big,
some little, and some men have done great deeds and others have
done small deeds, but they have made their hole in the blanket by
doing good before they went to Heaven.</p>

<p class='c007'>Try and make your hole in the blanket by good work
while you are on the earth.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is something to <i>be</i> good, but it is far better to <i>do</i>
good.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>
  <h5 class='c012'>THRIFT.</h5>
</div>
<p class='c004'>It is a funny thing that out of you boys who now read these
words, some of you are certain to become rich men, and
some of you may die in poverty and misery. And it
just depends on your own selves which you are going to
do.</p>

<p class='c005'>And you can very soon tell which your future is going
to be.</p>

<p class='c005'>The fellow who begins making money as a boy will go
on making it as a man. You may find it difficult to do
at first, but it will come easier later on; but if you begin
and if you go on, remember, you are pretty certain to
succeed in the end&mdash;especially if you get your money by
hard work.</p>

<p class='c005'>If you only try to make it by easy means&mdash;that is by
betting, say, on a football match or a horse-race&mdash;you are
bound to lose after a time. Nobody who makes bets
ever wins in the end; it is the book-maker, the man who
receives the bets, that scores over it. Yet there are
thousands of fools who go on putting their money on
because they won a bit once or hope to win some day.</p>

<p class='c005'>Any number of poor boys have become rich men&mdash;but
in nearly every case it was because they meant to do so
from the first; they worked for it, and put every penny
they could make into the bank to begin with.</p>

<p class='c005'>So each one of you has the chance if you like to take
it. The great owner of millions of pounds, J. Astor,
began his career as a poor boy-pedlar with seven German
flutes as his stock-in-trade. He sold them for more than
he gave and went on increasing his business.</p>

<p class='c005'>The knights of old were ordered by their rules to be
thrifty, that is to save money as much as possible, not to
expend large sums on their own enjoyment, but to save
it in order that they might keep themselves and not be
a burden to others, and also in order that they might
have more to give away in charity; and if they had no
money of their own, they were not allowed to beg for it,
they must work and make it in one way or another.
Thus money-making goes with manliness, hard work,
and sobriety.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>Boys are not too young to work for money.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr Thomas Holmes, the police-court missionary, tells
us how hundreds of poor boys in London are working
pluckily and well at making their living, even while
doing their school work. They get up early, at half-past
four in the morning, and go round with milk or bakers'
barrows till about eight, and after that off to school;
back in the afternoon to the shop to clean the pails and
cans. They save up their money every day; those who
have mothers, hand it over to them; those who have not,
store it up or bank it. They are regular men before
they are twelve years of age, and good examples to
other boys wherever they may be.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>HOW TO MAKE MONEY.</h5>
<p class='c004'>There are many ways by which a scout, or a patrol
working together, can make money, such as:</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Carpentering.</span>&mdash;Making arm-chairs, recovering old
furniture, etc., is a very paying trade. Fretwork and
carving, picture-frames, birdcages, cabinets, carved pipe-bowls,
can be sold through a shop.</p>

<p class='c005'>Get permission to cut certain sticks in hedges or
woods and trim them into walking-sticks, after hanging
them with weights attached to straighten and dry them.
Breeding canaries, chickens, rabbits, or dogs pays well.
Beekeeping brings in from £1 to £2 a year per hive,
after you have paid for hive and queen bee or swarm.</p>

<p class='c005'>You can make novel sets of buttons out of bootlaces.
Collect old packing cases and boxes and chop them
into bundles of firewood. Make nets, besoms, etc.,
for gardeners. Keeping goats and selling their milk
will pay in some places. Basket making, pottery, book-binding,
etc., all bring money. Or a patrol working
together can form themselves into a corps of messenger-boys
in a country town, or they can get an allotment
garden and work it for selling vegetables and flowers,
or they can make themselves into a minstrel troupe, or
perform scouting displays or pageants, etc., like those
shown in this book, and take money at the doors.</p>

<p>6. Pull all tight, cut off loose end, and the button is complete.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>These are only a few suggestions; there are loads
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>of other ways of making money which you can think out
for yourselves, according to the place you are in.</p>

<p class='c005'>But in order to get money you must expect to work.
The actor, Ted Payne, used to say in one of his plays,
"I don't know what is wrong with me, I eat well, I drink
well, and I sleep well, but somehow whenever anybody
mentions the word 'Work' to me I get a cold shudder
all over me." That is what happens to a great many
men in England, I am afraid. There are a good many
other chicken-hearted fellows, who, when any work faces
them "get a cold shudder all over them"; or when
trouble comes, they go and take to drink, instead of
facing it and working it off.</p>

<p class='c005'>Start a money-box, put any money you can make into
that, and when you have got a fair amount in it, hand it
over to a bank, and start an account for yourself. As a
scout, you have to have a certain amount in the savings
bank before you can become entitled to wear a badge.
Save your pence and you'll get pounds.</p>

<p class='c005'>(<i>Scouts' Money Boxes can be obtained from Manager
Boy Scouts, Henrietta Street, London, W.C.</i>)</p>
<h5 class='c012'>HOW TO GET ON.</h5>
<p class='c004'>A few years ago the American Government was at war
with rebels in the island of Cuba. (<i>Point out on map.</i>)</p>

<p class='c005'>America, as you know, is ruled by a President and not
by a King. The late President, McKinley, wanted to
send a letter to Garcia, the chief of the rebels in Cuba,
but did not know how to get it taken to him, as the
rebels were a savage lot inhabiting a wild and difficult
country.</p>

<p class='c005'>When he was talking it over with his advisers, someone
said: "There's a young fellow called Rowan who
seems to be able to get anything done that you ask him.
Why not try him?"</p>

<p class='c005'>So Rowan was sent for, and when he came in the
President explained why he had sent for him, and,
putting the letter in his hand, said: "Now, I want that
letter sent to Garcia."</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>The lad simply smiled and said, "I see," and walked
out of the room without saying another word.</p>

<p class='c005'>Some weeks passed and Rowan appeared again at the
President's door and said, "I gave your letter to Garcia,
sir," and walked out again. Of course, Mr. McKinley
had him back and made him explain how he had done it.</p>

<p class='c005'>It turned out that he had got a boat and sailed away
in her for some days; had landed on the coast of Cuba,
and disappeared into the jungle; in three weeks' time he
reappeared on the other side of the island having gone
through the enemy and found Garcia, and given him the
letter.</p>

<p class='c005'>He was a true scout, and that is the way a scout
should carry out an order when he gets it. No matter
how difficult it may seem he should tackle it, with a
smile; the more difficult it is the more interesting it will
be to carry out.</p>

<p class='c005'>Most fellows would have asked a lot of questions&mdash;first
as to how they were to set about it, how they could
get to the place, where were they to get food from, and
so on; but not so Rowan: he merely learnt what duty
was wanted of him, and <i>he</i> did the rest without a word;
any fellow who acts like that is certain to get on.</p>

<p class='c005'>We have a lot of good scouts already in England
among the District Messenger Boys in London. These
lads, from having difficult jobs frequently given them and
being <i>expected</i> to carry them out successfully, take them
on with the greatest confidence in themselves; and,
without asking a lot of silly questions, they start off in a
businesslike way, and do them.</p>

<p class='c005'>That is the way to deal with any difficulty in life. If you
get a job or a trouble that seems to you to be too big
for you, don't shirk it: smile, think out a way by which
you might get successfully through with it, and then go
at it.</p>

<p class='c005'>Remember that "a difficulty is no longer a difficulty
when once you laugh at it&mdash;and tackle it."</p>

<p class='c005'>Don't be afraid of making a mistake. Napoleon said
"Nobody ever made anything who never made a
mistake."</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span><span class='sc'>Memory.</span>&mdash;Then practise remembering things. A
fellow who has a good memory will get on because so
many other people have bad memories from not
practising them.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the Olympic Theatre, Liverpool, the forgetfulness
on the part of the people in the audience gradually
made it necessary for the manager to keep a special
room and ledgers for all lost articles left behind in the
theatre after each performance. But the happy idea
struck him of putting a notice on the curtain by means
of a bioscope lantern a few minutes before the end of the
performance saying, "Please look under your seat before
leaving."</p>

<p class='c005'>This has made a great difference in the number of
things left behind.</p>

<p class='c005'>People used to leave every kind of thing, even
medicine bottles, and false teeth; and once a cheque for
£50 was left.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Luck.</span>&mdash;A great coral island is build up of tiny sea
insects blocking themselves together; so also great
knowledge in a man is built up by his noticing all sorts
of little details and blocking them together in his mind
by <i>remembering</i> them.</p>

<p class='c005'>If you want to catch a tramcar when it is not at a
stopping station you don't sit down and let it run past
you and then say, "How unlucky I am"; you run and
jump on. It is just the same with what some people call
"luck"; they complain that luck never comes to them.
Well, luck is really the chance of getting something
good or of doing something great; the thing is to look
out for every chance and seize it&mdash;run at it and jump on&mdash;don't
sit down and wait for it to pass you. Opportunity
is a tramcar which has very few stopping places.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Choose a Career.</span>&mdash;"Be Prepared" for what is
going to happen to you in the future. If you are in a
situation where you are earning money as a boy what
are you going to do when you finish that job? You
ought to be learning some proper trade to take up; and
save your pay in the meantime, to keep you going till
you get employment in your new trade.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>And try to learn something of a second trade in case
the first one fails you at any time, as so very often
happens.</p>

<p class='c005'>If you want to serve your King and Country there is
the Royal Navy open to you, a fine service with its grand
traditions, its splendid ships, guns, and seamen. It takes
you across the seas to our great Colonies and to foreign
lands, from the frozen Arctic to the tropical coasts of
Africa.</p>

<p class='c005'>Or there is the Army, with cavalry, infantry, artillery,
engineers, and other branches, in which you can wear
the uniform of your country and do good work in every
climate under the sun.</p>

<p class='c005'>In either service a good and honourable career is open
to you&mdash;for you have everything found for you, food,
housing, clothing, and hospital, with good pay and the
certainty of promotion and pension for the rest of your
life if you make up your mind to serve loyally, steadily,
and well. In such a career you have plenty of adventure
and you are among good comrades and friends. And if
you start early to save your pay, and not to throw it
away as too many do, you can easily put by £25 a year
in the bank.</p>

  <h2 class='c024'>CONTINUATION OF PART IV. <br /> SOBRIETY.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c004'>Remember that drink never yet cured a single trouble;
it only makes troubles grow worse and worse the more
you go on with it. It makes a man forget for a few
hours what exactly his trouble is, but it also makes him
forget everything else. If he has wife and children it
makes him forget that his duty is to work and help them
out of the difficulties instead of making himself all the
more unfit to work.</p>

<p class='c005'>A man who drinks is generally a coward&mdash;and one
used to see it very much among soldiers. Nowadays
they are a better class and do not drink.</p>

<p class='c005'>Some men drink because they like the feeling of
getting half stupid, but they are fools, because once
they take to drink no employer will trust them, and
they soon become unemployed and easily get ill, and
finally come to a miserable end. There is nothing
manly about getting drunk. Once a man gives way to
drink it ruins his health, his career, and his happiness,
as well as that of his family. There is only one cure for
this disease, and that is&mdash;never to get it.</p>
<h3 class='c022'>PRACTISE OBSERVATION.</h3>
<p class='c004'>A well-known detective, Mr. Justin Chevasse, describes
how with a little practice in observation you can tell
pretty accurately a man's character from his dress.</p>

<p class='c005'>He tells the story of a Duke who used to dress very
shabbily. One day this nobleman was travelling by
train with a friend of his, Lord A. A commercial
traveller who was in the carriage got into conversation
with them. At one station the Duke got out, and after
he was gone the commercial traveller asked "Who is
the gentleman who has just got out?" "Oh," said Lord
A, "that is the Duke of X." The commercial traveller
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>was quite taken aback and said, "Fancy that! Fancy
him talking so affably to you and me. I thought all the
time that he must be a gardener."</p>

<p class='c005'>I expect that that commercial traveller had not been
brought up as a scout and did not look at people's boots:
if he had he would probably have seen that neither the
Duke's nor Lord A's were those of a gardener.</p>

<p class='c005'>The boots are very generally the best test of all the
details of clothing. I was with a lady the other day in
the country, and a young lady was walking just in front
of us. "I wonder who she is" said my friend. "Well,"
I said, "I should be inclined to say I wonder whose maid
she is." The girl was very well dressed but when I saw
her boots I guessed that the dress had belonged to
someone else, had been given to her and refitted by
herself&mdash;but that as regards boots she felt more comfortable
in her own. She went up to the house at which we
were staying&mdash;to the servants' entrance&mdash;and we found
that she was the maid of one of the ladies staying there.</p>

<p class='c005'>Dr. Gross relates the story of a learned old gentleman
who was found dead in his bedroom with a wound in his
forehead and another in his left temple.</p>

<p class='c005'>Very often after a murder the murderer, with his hands
bloody from the deed and running away, may catch hold
of the door, or a jug of water to wash his hands.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the present case a newspaper lying on the table had
the marks of three blood-stained fingers on it.</p>

<p class='c005'>The son of the murdered man was suspected and was
arrested by the police.</p>

<p class='c005'>But careful examination of the room and the prints of
the finger-marks showed that the old gentleman had been
taken ill in the night&mdash;had got out of bed to get some
medicine, but getting near the table a new spasm seized
him and he fell, striking his head violently against the
corner of the table and made the wound on his temple
which just fitted the corner. In trying to get up he had
caught hold of the table and the newspaper on it and had
made the bloody finger-marks on the newspaper in doing
so. Then he had fallen again, cutting his head a second
time on the foot of the bed.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>The finger-marks were compared with the dead man's
fingers, and were found to be exactly the same. Well,
you don't find two men in 64,000,000,000,000 with the
same pattern on the skin of their fingers. So it was
evident there had been no murder, and the dead man's
son was released as innocent.</p>
<h3 class='c022'>FORTITUDE.</h3>
<p class='c004'>In Japan, whenever a child is born, the parents
hang up outside the house either a doll or a fish,
according as the child is a girl or boy. It is a sign to
the neighbours: the doll means it is a girl, who will
some day have children to nurse; the fish means it is a
boy, who, as he grows into manhood, will, like a fish,
have to make his way against a stream of difficulties and
dangers. A man who cannot face hard work or trouble is
not worth calling a man.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/fig120.jpg' alt='Perseverance: Frogs in the Milk.' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Perseverance: Frogs in the Milk.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Some of you may have heard the story of the two frogs.
If you have not, here it is:</p>

<p class='c005'>Two frogs were out for a walk one day and they came
to a big jug of cream. In looking into it they both fell in.</p>

<p class='c005'>One said: "This is a new kind of water to me. How
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>can a fellow swim in stuff like this? It is no use trying."
So he sank to the bottom and was drowned through
having no pluck.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the other was a more manly frog, and he struggled
to swim, using his arms and legs as hard as he could to
keep himself afloat; and whenever he felt he was sinking
he struggled harder than ever, and never gave up hope.</p>

<p class='c005'>At last, just as he was getting so tired that he thought
he <i>must</i> give it up, a curious thing happened. By his
hard work with his arms and legs he had churned up the
cream so much that he suddenly found himself standing
all safe on a pat of butter!</p>

<p class='c005'>So when things look bad just smile and sing to yourself,
as the thrush sings: "Stick to it, stick to it, stick to
it," and you will come through all right.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Duty Before All.</span>&mdash;You have all heard of "Lynch-Law,"
by which is meant stern justice by hanging an evil-doer.</p>

<p class='c005'>The name came from Galway in Ireland where a
memorial still commemorates the act of a chief magistrate
of that city named Lynch who in the year 1493 had his
own son Walter Lynch executed for killing a young
Spaniard.</p>

<p class='c005'>The murderer had been properly tried and convicted.
His mother begged the citizens to rescue her son when he
was brought out from the jail to suffer punishment, but
the father foreseeing this had the sentence carried out in
the prison, and young Lynch was hanged from the
prison window.</p>

<p class='c005'>The elder Lynch's sense of duty must have been very
strong indeed to enable him to make his feelings as a
father give way to his conscience as a magistrate.</p>

<p class='c005'>General Gordon sacrificed his life to his sense of duty.
When he was besieged at Khartum he could have got
away himself had he liked, but he considered it his duty
to remain with the Egyptians whom he had brought there
although he had no admiration for them. So he stuck to
them and when at last the place was captured by the
enemy he was killed.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>
  <h3 class='c022'>NOTES TO INSTRUCTORS</h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Religion.</span></h4>
<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Charles Stelzle</span>, in his "Boys of the Streets and
How to Win Them," says:</p>

<p class='c009'>Sometimes we are so much concerned about there being enough
religion in our plans for the boy that we forget to leave enough boy
in the plans. According to the notions of some, the ideal boys' club
would consist of prayer meetings and Bible classes, with an
occasional missionary talk as a treat, and perhaps magic lantern
views of the Holy Land as a dizzy climax.</p>

<p class='c007'>Religion can and ought to be taught to the boy, but
not in a milk-and-watery way, or in a mysterious and
lugubrious manner; he is very ready to receive it if it is
shown in its heroic side and as a natural every-day
quality in every proper man, and it can be well introduced
to boys through the study of Nature; and to those
who believe scouting to be an unfit subject for Sunday
instruction, surely the study of God's work is at least
proper for that day. There is no need for this instruction
to be dismal, that is, "all tears and texts." Arthur
Benson, writing in the <i>Cornhill Magazine</i>, says there
are four Christian virtues, not three. They are&mdash;Faith,
Hope, Charity&mdash;and Humour. So also in the morning
prayer of Robert Louis Stevenson:</p>

<p class='c009'>The day returns and brings us the petty round of irritating
concerns and duties. Help us to play the man&mdash;help us to perform
them with laughter and kind faces. Let cheerfulness abound with
industry. Give us to go blithely on our business all this day. Bring
us to our resting beds weary and content and undishonoured, and
grant us in the end the gift of sleep.</p>
<h4 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Thrift.</span></h4>
<p class='c004'>A very large proportion of the distress and unemployedness
in the country is due to want of thrift on the
part of the people themselves; and social reformers,
before seeking for new remedies, would do well to set this
part of the problem right in the first place; they would
then probably find very little more left for them to do.
Mr. John Burns, in a recent speech, pointed out that there
is plenty of money in the country to put everyone on a
fair footing, if only it were made proper use of by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>working man. In some places, it is true, there is thrift&mdash;workmen
save their pay and buy their own houses, and
become prosperous, contented citizens in happy homes.
It is estimated that £500,000,000 of working-men's
money is invested in savings banks and friendly societies.
But there is a reverse to the medal. This great balance
represents savings of many years, whereas it could be
doubled in two or three years were men to give up
drinking and smoking.</p>

<p class='c005'>Where we deposit £4 per head per annum in savings
banks, other countries deposit far more, although earning
lower wages, and in Denmark such deposits amount,
on an average, to £19 per head.</p>

<p class='c005'>£166,000,000 were spent last year on drink, and
£25,000,000 on tobacco. This alone would be enough,
if divided amongst our thirty-five millions of poor, to
give £22 a year to each family; and we know that this
is only part of the extravagance of the nation. From
£8000 to £10,000 a week is estimated to go into the
pockets of the bookmakers at Liverpool and its surrounding
towns at football. Holiday, or "Going Off"
clubs, are common in Lancashire, where workers save up
money to spend on their holidays. In Blackburn alone
£117,000 was thus expended last year. At Oldham
£25,000 was saved to be expended in festivities at the
"Wakes."</p>

<p class='c005'>The wastefulness in Great Britain is almost inconceivable,
and ought to be made criminal. Men draw
big wages of £3 and £4 on Saturday nights, but have
nothing to show for it by Monday night. If they had
thrift a large majority of our working-men and their
families might be in prosperous circumstances to-day,
but they have never been taught what thrift may be, and
they naturally do as their neighbours do. If the rising
generation could be started in the practice of economy,
it would make a vast difference to the character and
prosperity of the nation in the future.</p>

<p class='c005'>In Manchester the school children are encouraged to
save up their money by means of money-boxes, and
44,000 of them now have deposits in the savings banks.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>It has been found a very successful way of encouraging
thrift. For this reason we have instituted money-boxes
for Boy Scouts.</p>
<h4 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Politeness.</span></h4>
<p class='c004'>An instance of politeness in war occurred at the Battle
of Fontenoy, when we were fighting against the French.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Coldstream Guards coming up over a hill suddenly
found themselves close up to the French Guards. Both
parties were surprised, and neither fired a shot for a
minute or two.</p>

<p class='c005'>In those days when gallant men quarrelled, they used
to settle their differences by fighting duels with pistols.
At a duel both combatants were supposed to fire at the
same moment when the word was given, but it often
happened that one man, in order to show how brave he
was, would tell his adversary to fire first. And so in this
case. When both parties were about to fire, the officer
commanding the British Guards, to show his politeness
and fearlessness, bowed to the French commander, and
said, "You fire first, sir."</p>

<p class='c005'>When the French Guards levelled their rifles to fire,
one of the soldiers of the Coldstreams exclaimed, "For
what we are going to receive may the Lord make us
truly thankful." In the volley that followed, a great
number of our men fell, but the survivors returned an
equally deadly volley, and immediately charged in with
the bayonet, and drove the French off the field.</p>

<p class='c005'>How to Deal with Accidents.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>CAMP FIRE YARN.&mdash;No. 23. <br /> BE PREPARED FOR ACCIDENTS.</h4>
<p class='c004'>The Knights Hospitallers of St. John&mdash;Boy Heroes and
Girl Heroines&mdash;Life-Saving Medals.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>HINTS TO INSTRUCTORS.</h5>
<p class='c004'><i>The subjects in this chapter should not only be explained
to the scouts, but should also, wherever possible,
be demonstrated practically, and should be practised by
each boy himself in turn.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>Theoretical knowledge in these points is nothing without
practice.</i></p>
<h5 class='c012'>THE KNIGHTS OF ST. JOHN.</h5>
<p class='c004'>The knights of old days were called Knights Hospitallers,
because they had hospitals for the treatment of the sick
poor and those injured in accidents or in war. They used
to save up their money to keep these hospitals going,
and they used to act as nurses and doctors themselves.
The Knights of St. John of Jerusalem especially devoted
themselves to this work 800 years ago, and the St.
John's Ambulance Corps is to-day a branch which represents
those knights. Their badge is an eight-pointed
white cross on a black ground, and when worn as an
Order it has a black ribbon.</p>

<p class='c005'>Explorers and hunters and other scouts in out-of-the-way
parts of the world have to know what to do in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>case of accident or sickness, either to themselves or
their followers, as they are often hundreds of miles away
from any doctors. For these reasons boy scouts should,
of course, learn all they can about looking after sick
people and dealing with accidents.</p>

<p class='c005'>My brother was once camping with a friend away in
the bush in Australia. His friend was drawing a cork,
holding the bottle between his knees to get a better
purchase. The bottle burst, and the jagged edge of it
ran deeply into his thigh, cutting an artery. My brother
quickly got a stone and wrapped it in a handkerchief to
act as a pad, and he then tied the handkerchief round
the limb above the wound, so that the stone pressed on
the artery. He then got a stick, and, passing it through
the loop of the handkerchief, twisted it round till the
bandage was drawn so tight that it stopped the flow of
blood. Had he not known what to do, the man would
have bled to death in a few minutes. As it was, he
saved his life by knowing what to do, and doing it at once.</p>

<p class='c005'>[<i>Demonstrate how to bind up an artery, and also the
course taken by the arteries, viz., practically down the
inside seam of sleeves and trousers.</i>]</p>

<p class='c005'>Accidents are continually happening, and Boy Scouts
will continually have a chance of giving assistance at first
aid. In London alone during the past year 212 people
were killed and 14,000 were injured in street accidents.</p>

<p class='c005'>We all think a great deal of any man who at the risk
of his own life saves someone else's.</p>

<p class='c005'>He is a hero.</p>

<p class='c005'>Boys especially think him so, because he seems to them
to be a being altogether different from themselves.
But he isn't; every boy has just as much a chance of
being a life-saving hero if he chooses to prepare himself
for it.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is pretty certain that nearly every one of you scouts
will some day or another be present at an accident
where, if you know what to do, and do it promptly, you
may win for yourself the life-long satisfaction of having
rescued or helped a fellow-creature.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>Remember your motto, "<span class='sc'>Be Prepared</span>." Be prepared
for accidents by learning beforehand what you
ought to do in the different kinds that are likely to
occur.</p>

<p class='c005'>Be prepared to do that thing the moment the accident
does occur.</p>

<p class='c005'>I will explain to you what ought to be done in the
different kinds of accidents, and we will practise them
as far as possible.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the great thing for you scouts to bear in mind is
that wherever you are, and whatever you are doing, you
should think to yourself, "What accident is likely to
occur here?" and, "What is my duty if it occurs?"</p>

<p class='c005'>You are then prepared to act.</p>

<p class='c005'>And when an accident does occur, remember always
that as a scout it is your business to be the first man to
go to the rescue; don't let an outsider be beforehand
with you.</p>

<p class='c005'>Suppose, for instance, that you are standing on a
crowded platform at a station, waiting for the train.</p>

<p class='c005'>You think to yourself, "Now, supposing someone fell
off this platform on to the rails just as the train is coming
in, what shall I do? I must jump down and jerk him
off the track on to the far side into the six-foot way&mdash;there
would be no time to get him up on to the platform
again. Or if the train were very close the only way
would be to lie flat and make him lie flat too between
the rails, and let the train go over us both."</p>

<p class='c005'>Then, if this accident happened, you would at once
jump down and carry out your idea, while everybody
else would be running about screaming and excited and
doing nothing, not knowing what to do.</p>

<p class='c005'>Such a case actually happened last year. A lady
fell off the platform at Finsbury Park Station just as the
train was coming in; a man named Albert Hardwick
jumped down and lay flat, and held her down, too,
between the rails, while the train passed over both of
them without touching them. The King gave him the
Albert Medal for it.</p>

<p class='c005'>When there is a panic among those around you, you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>get a momentary inclination to do as the others are
doing. Perhaps it is to run away, perhaps it is to stand
still and cry out "Oh!" Well, you should check yourself
when you have this feeling. Don't catch the panic,
as you see others do; keep your head and think what is
the right thing to do, and do it at once.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then last year that disgraceful scene occurred on
Hampstead Heath, where a woman drowned herself
before a whole lot of people in a shallow pond, and took
half-an-hour doing it, while not one of them had the
pluck to go in and bring her out. One would not have
thought it possible with Englishmen that a lot of men
could only stand on the bank and chatter, but so it was&mdash;to
their eternal disgrace.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was again a case of panic. The first man to arrive on
the scene did not like going in, and merely called another.
More came up, but finding that those already there did not
go in, they got a sort of fear of something uncanny, and
would not go in themselves, and so let the poor woman
drown before their eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>Had one Boy Scout been there, there would I hope
have been a very different tale to tell. It was just the
opportunity for a Boy Scout to distinguish himself. He
would have remembered his training.</p>

<p class='c005'>Do your duty.</p>

<p class='c005'>Help your fellow-creature, especially if it be a
woman.</p>

<p class='c005'>Don't mind if other people are funking.</p>

<p class='c005'>Plunge in boldly and look to the object you are trying
to attain, and don't bother about your own safety.</p>

<p class='c005'>Boys have an idea that they are too young and too
small to take any but an outside part in saving life. But
this is a great mistake. In the Boys' Brigade last year
nine boys got the Cross for saving life, eight of them
for saving other people from drowning. All aged
between 13 and 16.</p>

<p class='c005'>Cyril Adion (13) and Newlyn Elliott (17) also saved
lives from drowning last year, and a small boy only nine
years old, David Scannell, was given a silver watch at
St. Pancras for saving a child's life at a fire.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>In addition to this, a boy named Albert Abraham was
recommended for the highest honour that any man can
get for saving life, and that is the Albert Medal.</p>

<p class='c005'>Three boys were climbing up some cliffs from the seashore,
when one of them fell to the bottom and was very
badly hurt. Another climbed up the rest of the cliff
and ran away home, but told nobody for fear of getting
into trouble. The third one, Albert Abraham,
climbed down again to the assistance of the boy who
had fallen, and he found him lying head downwards between
two rocks, with his scalp nearly torn off and his
leg broken.</p>

<p class='c005'>Abraham dragged him up out of reach of the tide, for
where he had fallen he was in danger of being drowned,
and then replaced his scalp and bound it on, and also
set his leg as well as he could, and bound it up in splints,
having learned the "First Aid" duties of the St. John's
Ambulance Society. Then he climbed up the cliff
and gathered some ferns and made a bed for the injured
boy.</p>

<p class='c005'>He stayed with him all that day, and when night came
on he still remained with him, nor did he desert him
even when a great seal climbed on to the rocks close
to him and appeared to be rather aggressive. He drove
it off with stones.</p>

<p class='c005'>Parties went out and eventually rescued both boys,
but the injured one died soon after, in spite of the
efforts that Albert Abraham had made to save him.</p>

<p class='c005'>In talking of boys I may as well state that the same
remark applies to women and girls, that they are not
only capable of doing valuable work in saving life, but
they have done so over and over again.</p>

<p class='c005'>For the Albert Medal a small girl aged nine has been
recommended. Kate Chapman endeavoured to rescue
two small children from being run over by a runaway cart.
She succeeded in doing so, but was herself run over and
badly injured in the attempt.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Ann Racebottom was awarded the Albert Medal
in 1881 for rescuing some school children when the roof
of the schoolhouse had fallen in upon them and she got
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>them out by crawling in under the falling ruins at the
greatest risk to her own life.</p>

<p class='c005'>Doris Kay, of Leytonstone, is only eight years old,
but she was awarded the diploma for life saving by
the Royal Humane Society last year.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>LIFE-SAVING MEDALS.</h5>
<p class='c004'>In war, as you know, the Victoria Cross is awarded to
soldiers for performing acts of valour.</p>

<p class='c005'>So, in peace, a decoration is given to anybody who distinguishes
himself by bravery in saving life at the risk of
his own.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Albert Medal is the highest of these rewards.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Royal Humane Society also give medals or
certificates.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Edward Medal is granted for gallantry in accidents
which so frequently happen in mines.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the Boys' Brigade medals are given for acts of
daring and self-sacrifice in saving life or marked courage
in the face of danger.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the Boy Scouts we have a medal for gallantry,
which is granted for similar acts.</p>

<p class='c005'>But of all these the Albert Medal and the Edward
Medal are the most valued, being given by the King
himself, and only in very special cases.</p>

<p class='c005'>So let every Boy Scout prepare himself to win one of
these. Some day, most probably, an accident will happen
before you to give you your chance. If you have learnt
beforehand what to do, you can step forward at once and
do the right thing; you may find yourself decorated with
the medal. In any case, you will have what is far
greater than a mere medal&mdash;you will have the satisfaction
of having helped a fellow-creature at the risk of
your own life.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>PRACTICE FOR LIFE SAVING.</h5>
<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Flinging the Squaler.</span></p>

<p class='c005'>The squaler is a piece of cane, 19 inches long, loaded at
the butt with 1-3/4lb. of lead, and having attached to it at
the other end a life-saving line of six-thread Italian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>hemp. The target is a crossbar and head, life-size,
representing the head and arms of a drowning man,
planted in the ground twenty yards away. Each competitor
throws in turn from behind a line drawn on the
ground; he may stand or run to make the throw. Whoever
throws the furthest wins, provided that the line falls
on some part of the dummy, so that it could be caught by
the drowning man.</p>

<p class='c005'>Or have heats to find out who is the worst thrower.</p>

<p class='c005'>Practise throwing a life-belt in the same way.</p>

<p class='c005'>Practise making two lines of bucket-men, for full and
empty buckets. Each line to relieve the other frequently
by exchanging duties.</p>

<p class='c005'>Practise carrying, unrolling, and rolling up hose.
Joining up lengths. Affixing to hydrants. Throwing
on water, and directing its fall.</p>

<p class='c005'>Practise use of ladders, poles, ropes, lowering people
from window by ropes or bed-clothes. Jumping sheet
and shoot-escape; how to rig, hold, and use carpets
or double blankets, but not flimsy ones or sheets.</p>

</div>
<p class='c004'>Panic&mdash;Fire&mdash;Drowning&mdash;Runaway Horse&mdash;Mad Dog&mdash;Miscellaneous.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>PANICS.</h5>
<p class='c004'>Every year numbers of lives are lost by panics, which
very often are due to the smallest causes, and which
might be stopped if only one or two men would keep
their heads. One evening, two years ago, on board a
ferry-boat in New York, a man who had been catching
some crabs thought it would be a good joke to let one
of them loose on board the boat. This crab caught hold
of the ship's cat and made it squeal, and it jumped into
the middle of a crowd of schoolgirls, who at once scattered
screaming. This started a panic among the
hundreds of passengers on board; they rushed in every
direction, and in a moment the railings broke and eight
people fell overboard, and before anything could be
done they were swept away by the tide and drowned.</p>

<p class='c005'>In Germany, a girl who was bathing suddenly pretended
to be drowning, just for fun. Three men sprang
into the river to rescue her, but one began to sink, and
another went to his help, and both were drowned. And
only last September a tobacconist in a town in Russia,
on opening his shop in the morning, saw a big black
bomb lying on the counter. He rushed out into the
street to get away from it, and a policeman seeing him
running mistook him for a thief, and when he would not
stop he fired at him. The bullet missed him, but hit
another man who was a Jew; the remainder of the Jews
immediately collected and made a riot, and many lives
were lost. After it was over, the tobacconist went back
to his shop and found the bomb still on his counter, but
it was not a bomb, it was only a black water-melon!</p>

<p class='c005'>Only the other day occurred a case of panic among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>children in a theatre at Barnsley, when a crush and panic
occurred from no cause at all except overcrowding, and
eight children were crushed to death. More lives would
certainly have been lost had not two men kept their heads
and done the right thing. One man named Gray called
to a number of the children in a cheery voice to come
another way, while the man who was working a lantern-slide
show threw a picture on the screen and so diverted
the attention of the rest, and prevented them catching
the panic. That is the great point in a panic. If only
one or two men keep their heads and do the right thing
on the spur of the moment, they can often calm hundreds
of people and thus save many lives.</p>

<p class='c005'>This is a great opportunity for a Boy Scout. Force
yourself to keep calm and not to lose your head. Think
what is the right thing to do and do it at once.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>RESCUE FROM FIRE.</h5>
<p class='c004'>Instances of gallant rescues of people from burning
houses are frequent. One sees them every day in the
newspapers, and scouts should study each of these cases
as they occur, and imagine to themselves what they
would have done under the circumstances, and in this
way you begin to learn how to deal with the different
accidents. An instance occurred only the other day
where a young sailor named George Obeney stationed at
Chatham in H.M.S. <i>Andromeda</i> was walking along the
Kingsland Road, when he suddenly saw a house on fire,
and a woman on the second storey was screaming that
she had some children there who could not get out. The
sailor rushed from his friends and somehow scrambled up
the face of the wall till he reached the window on the
first storey and broke in that window so that he could
obtain room to stand. The woman at the window above
was then able to lower a child so that he could catch it,
and he again passed it down to the ground. Child after
child was thus handed down till he passed six of them to
the ground, and finally two women, and then he, overcome
by smoke himself, fell insensible, but was caught
by the people below. His act was an example to you of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>how to do your duty <span class='fss'>AT ONCE</span> without thinking of dangers
or difficulties.</p>

<p class='c005'>In January, 1906, at Enfield Hospital, the Children's
Ward caught fire in the middle of the night, and a
number of children would probably have been burnt
before the firemen arrived on the spot had it not been
that the matron, Miss Eardley, rushed over from her
house in her nightdress and fixed up the fire-hose and
played it on the flames while the two night nurses set to
work and rescued twenty children out of the burning
building.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Boys' Life Brigade have taken up the instruction
of boys in what to do in cases of fire.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>DIRECTIONS.</h5>
<p class='c004'>These are some of their directions:</p>

<p class='c005'>If you discover a house on fire you should</p>

<p class='c009'>1st. Alarm the people inside.</p>

<p class='c010'>2nd. Warn the nearest policeman or fire brigade
station.</p>

<p class='c010'>3rd. Rouse neighbours to bring ladders, mattresses,
carpets, to catch people jumping.</p>

<p class='c007'>After arrival of fire engines the best thing boys can
do is to help the police in keeping back the crowd out
of the way of the firemen, hose, etc.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Boys' Life Brigade are taught a certain drill
called "Scrum" for keeping back the crowd. They
form a line or double line, and pass their arms round
each other's waists, and shove, head down, into the
crowd, and so drive it back.</p>

<p class='c005'>If it is necessary to go into a house to search for
feeble or insensible people, the thing is to place a wet
handkerchief or worsted stocking over your nose and
mouth and walk in a stooping position, or crawl along
on your hands and knees quite near the floor, as it is
here that there is least smoke or gas. Also, for passing
through fire and sparks, if you can, get hold of a blanket
and wet it, and cut a hole in the middle through which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>to put your head, it forms a kind of fireproof mantle
with which you can push through flames and sparks.
[<i>Practise this.</i>]</p>

<p class='c005'>When a fire occurs anywhere near the Boy Scouts
should assemble their patrols as quickly as possible, and
go off at scouts' pace to the fire, guided by the glare or
the smoke. Then the patrol leader should report to the
police or firemen, and offer the help of his patrol either
to keep the crowd back or to run messages or guard
property or to help in any way.</p>

<p class='c005'>If you find a person with his clothes on fire, you
should throw him flat on the floor, because flames only
burn upwards, then roll him up in the hearthrug or
carpet, coat or blanket, and take care in doing so that
you don't catch fire yourself. The reason for doing this
is that fire cannot continue to burn when it has no air.
Then pour water over the patient to put out all sparks.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Dragging Insensible Man: Both heads down near the floor.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>When you find an insensible person (and very often
in their fright they will have hidden themselves away
under beds and tables, etc.), you should either carry him
out on your shoulder, or what is often more practicable
in the case of heavy smoke, gas fumes, etc., harness
yourself on to him with sheets or cords, and drag him
out of the room along the floor, crawling on all fours
yourself.</p>

<p class='c009'>[<i>Practise this by tying a bowline round the patient's
waist, another round his ankles, and another round
your own neck. Turn your back to him, go on all
fours with the rope underneath you, and thus drag
him out. Also practise the "Fireman's Lift" for
getting an insensible person on to your shoulders.</i>]</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>
  <h5 class='c012'>RESCUE FROM DROWNING.</h5>
</div>
<p class='c004'>The list of Boys' Brigade heroes shows you what a
large proportion of accidents are due to not knowing
how to swim. It is therefore most important that every
boy should learn to swim, and having done so to learn
how to save others from being drowned.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Holbein, the great Channel swimmer, writing in
<i>The Boys' Own Paper</i>, points out that a boy, when
learning to swim, should learn first how to get
in and out of a boat, <i>i.e.</i>, by climbing in over the stern.
Secondly, how to support himself on an oar or plank,
<i>i.e.</i>, by riding astride on it, or by catching hold of one
end and pushing it before him and swimming with his
legs. Thirdly, how to get into a floating lifebuoy, <i>i.e.</i>,
by shoving the nearest side of it down under water
and capsizing it over his head and shoulders, so that he
is inside it when it floats. Fourthly, how to save life.</p>

<p class='c009'>[<i>Practise these at swimming baths or bathing
parade.</i>]</p>

<p class='c007'>A moderate swimmer can save a drowning man if he
knows how, and has practised it a few times with his
friends. The popular idea that a drowning person rises
three times before he finally sinks is all nonsense. He
often drowns at once, unless someone is quick to help
him. The important point is not to let the drowning
person catch hold of you, or he will probably drown you
too. Keep behind him always. If you find yourself
clutched by the wrist, turn your wrist against his thumb,
and force yourself free. Your best way in helping a
drowning man is to keep behind and hold him up by the
hair, or by the back of the neck, or by putting your arms
under his armpits, and telling him to keep quiet and not
to struggle; if he obeys, you can easily keep him afloat;
but otherwise be careful that in his terror he does not
turn over and catch hold of you. If he should seize you
by the neck, Holbein says, "Scrag him, and scrag him
quickly. Place your arm round his waist, and the other
hand, palm upwards, under his chin, with your finger-tips
under his nose. Pull and push with all your might, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>he must perforce let go." But you will never remember
this unless you practise it frequently with other boys
first, each taking it in turns to be the drowning man
rescuer.</p>

<p class='c009'>[<i>Practise this.</i>]</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the innumerable cases of saving life from
drowning, Mr. Scullion was recommended for the Albert
Medal. He sprang into the river to save a boy from
drowning who had fallen between the wharf and the
ship's side. When he got hold of the boy there was no
room for him to swim in that narrow space, and the tide
was very strong, so he dived down, taking the boy with
him, under the ship's bottom, and came up in open
water on the other side of the ship, and then easily swam
to a boat and thus rescued him. Had he not kept his
head and dived under the ship, it is probable that both
would have been drowned.</p>

<p class='c005'>Any of you who cannot swim as yet, and who fall into
the water out of your depth, remember that you need not
sink if you can remember to do the following things.
First, keep your mouth upwards by throwing the head
well back. Secondly, keep your lungs full of air by
taking in long breaths, but breathe out very little.
Thirdly, keep your arms under water. To do this you
should not begin to shout, which will only empty your
lungs, and you should not throw your arms about or
beckon for help, else you will sink.</p>

<p class='c009'>[<i>Practise this position.</i>]</p>

<p class='c007'>If you see a person fall into the water and begin to
drown, and you yourself are unable to swim, you must
throw him a rope, or an oar, or plank right over him, so
that when he comes up again he may clutch at it and
hold it. If a person falls through ice, and is unable to
get out again because of the edges breaking, throw him
a rope, and tell him not to struggle. This may give him
confidence until you can get a long ladder or pole which
will enable him to crawl out, or will allow you to crawl
out to catch hold of him.</p>

  <h5 class='c012'>RESCUE FROM RUNAWAY HORSES.</h5>
</div>
<p class='c004'>Accidents are continually recurring from runaway
horses running over people. In fact, on an average,
the number of runaway horses that are stopped by
policemen during the year amounts to over two hundred;
and it is well that everybody should know how to stop a
runaway horse, and thus to save numerous accidents
and injuries.</p>

<p class='c005'>Private Davies, of the 16th Lancers, was awarded the
Albert Medal, at Aldershot, for stopping the horses of an
artillery wagon, which had become unmanageable and run
away. The driver, who was riding one of them, had been
thrown off, and the horses were careering down hill towards
the married quarters of the cavalry barracks, where a
number of children were at play, when Private Davies,
seeing the danger to the children, ran to the horses, and
seizing the off horse with his right hand, held on to the
shaft with his left, and endeavoured to stop the waggon.
He was dragged in that position for some yards when
the chain fastening the shafts to the waggon gave way
and let the shafts fall, bringing Davies also to the
ground.</p>

<p class='c005'>The waggon passed over his legs, and very severely
injured him, and, though he did not actually succeed in
stopping the horses, he so diverted them from their
course that time was given for the children to be saved
from being run over.</p>

<p class='c005'>Not long ago a lady was being run away with by her
horse in Hyde Park. The animal was tearing along
quite mad with fright, and though she was a good rider
and kept her head, she had no control over him whatever.</p>

<p class='c005'>The danger was that the road on which he was
galloping, though straight for a good distance, turned
at the end very sharply, and was bounded by a high
iron railing. Now a horse when he is thoroughly
frightened seems to lose his sight as well as his wits;
he will run over a cliff or into a wall without trying to
stop, and on this occasion it seemed most likely that he
would charge into the great iron railings at the end of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>the road, and the consequences to the girl on his back
would have been too awful to think of.</p>

<p class='c005'>In front of her as she came thundering along were
two gentlemen riding quietly along talking together,
heading in the same direction that she was going. One
of them&mdash;it was the Hon. George Wyndham, at that
time Chief Secretary for Ireland&mdash;turned his head to see
what was happening behind him, and in one moment he
grasped the whole situation, saw what to do, and did it.
He saw that a girl was being rushed to her death by the
maddened horse if something were not done to stop it,
or to make it turn round the corner at the end of the
road which was now not far away.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now what would any of you have done had you been
in Mr. Wyndham's place?</p>

<p class='c005'>He saw that to put his horse across her path would be
easy, but if he did so it would probably throw both
horses down, and possibly kill both riders; so what he
did was to put his own horse at once into a gallop, and
for a moment it looked as if he were running away, with
the lady chasing him at full speed. But it soon became
evident what he was doing.</p>

<p class='c005'>He gradually let the lady's horse overtake him until
its head was abreast of him and close alongside him, then
he gradually turned his own horse for taking the corner,
and, pressing all the time against the shoulder of the
lady's horse, forced it also gradually to turn with him till
it was safely directed away from the railings and into
the new direction of the road, and here, while still keeping
partly ahead of it, he got hold of its reins, and in a short
time succeeded in pulling it up and bringing it to its
senses.</p>

<p class='c005'>This is a lesson to everyone to <span class='sc'>Be Prepared</span>, even at
most ordinary moments of strolling along, talking to a
friend, to spring at once to the assistance of a fellow-creature
who is in danger.</p>

<p class='c005'>The other day I myself found a horse and cab running
away over Westminster Bridge, but I stopped it without any
difficulty. The way to stop a runaway horse is not to run
out in front of it and wave your arms, as so many people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>do, but to try and race alongside it, catch hold of the shaft
to keep yourself from falling, and seize the reins with the
other hand, and drag the horse's head round towards
you, and so turn him until you can bring him up against
a wall or house, or otherwise compel him to stop. But,
of course, for a boy, with his light weight, this is a very
difficult thing to do. The share he would have in such
an accident would probably be to look after the people
injured by the runaway horse.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>MISCELLANEOUS ACCIDENTS.</h5>
<p class='c004'>One cannot go through the whole list of accidents that
might come under your notice, but the point is that a
scout should always remember to keep his head, and
think what is the right thing to do at the moment, and
be the man to do it, even under the most unexpected
circumstances.</p>

<p class='c005'>Police-Sergeant Cole was awarded the Albert Medal
some years ago for removing a dynamite bomb, which he
found in Westminster Hall. It was already lit for exploding,
and instead of running away and taking cover
himself he snatched it up and rushed out of the place
and flung it away, and very nearly lost his life in the
explosion which followed immediately after. Had he
hesitated to think what would be the best thing to do he
would probably have lost his own life, and have allowed
the place to be smashed up.</p>

<p class='c005'>A man named John Smith was awarded the Albert
Medal, because one day, when at his work in a steel-casting
factory, a great, red-hot steel ingot, weighing
26 tons, was about being hoisted out of a casting-pit,
when one of the workmen named Stanley slipped, and
fell into the pit, which was fifteen feet deep, alongside
the ingot in a space of about two feet, which existed
between the ingot and the wall of the pit. John Smith
immediately got a ladder and ran down into the next pit,
from which there was a passage communicating into the
first one, and in this way he managed to get into the
lower part of the ingot pit and drag Stanley out of it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>into the empty one. Stanley died of his burns two days
later, but Smith, though badly burnt himself, recovered
to wear the Albert Medal.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>MAD DOG.</h5>
<p class='c004'>A dog that is mad runs along snapping at everybody
in his path. Every scout should know what to do when
there is a mad dog about, and should be prepared to
do it.</p>

<p class='c005'>Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton was one day out for a ride
when his dog, which was running with him, went mad,
and started to run through the town.</p>

<p class='c005'>Sir Thomas edged him off the road and drove him into
a garden. He then jumped off his horse, ran at the
dog, and succeeded in grabbing him by the neck without
getting bitten. Then followed a tremendous struggle
between man and dog.</p>

<p class='c005'>At last the gardener came and brought a chain which
Sir Thomas then clipped on, and only when the other
end had been securely fastened to a tree he let go his
hold of the dog. The dog was then raving mad and
tore at his chain so badly that it was in danger of breaking,
when Sir Thomas went at him again with a second
and stronger chain, and pinning him down by the neck
with a pitchfork he fastened it on to him. When this
was done and the pitchfork removed the dog sprang at
him with such force that it burst the old chain. Luckily
the new one held. And soon after the dog died.</p>

<p class='c005'>The way to prevent a dog biting you is to hold a stick,
or even a handkerchief, in your two hands across your
front, and the dog will generally try to paw it down
before he actually bites you, and you may thus get a
chance of landing him a kick under the jaw.</p>

<h5 class='c012'>RENDERING FIRST AID.</h5>
<p class='c004'>[<span class='sc'>Note to Instructor.</span>&mdash;<i>It is impossible in the
short space at one's disposal to give all the details of
First Aid. These can be found in any of the books
mentioned at the end of this Camp Fire Yarn.</i>]</p>

<p class='c005'>In an accident when you are alone with the injured
person, if he is unconscious lay him on his back with his
head a little raised and on one side so that he does not
choke, and so that any vomit or water, etc., can run
out of his mouth. Loosen the clothing about his neck
and chest. See where he is injured and treat him
according to what you are taught in learning "First
Aid."</p>

<p class='c005'>If you have found the man lying insensible you should
carefully examine the ground round him for any "sign,"
and take note of it and of his position, etc., in case it
should afterwards appear that he had been attacked by
others.</p>

<p class='c009'>[<i>Practise above, one boy as patient, the other to find
him. Make "sign" round the patient.</i>]</p>

<p class='c007'>If you are out with a patrol and an accident happens,
or you find an injured man, the patrol leader should
direct one scout to go for a doctor; he himself will
attend to the patient with one scout to help him. The
corporal will use the other scouts in assisting by getting
water or blankets, or making a stretcher, or keeping the
crowd back.</p>

<p class='c005'>As a rule, it is best to keep the patient quite quiet at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>first; unless it is necessary, do not try to move him;
and don't bother him with questions until he recovers
a bit.</p>

<p class='c009'>[<i>Practise above.</i>]</p>

<p>Artificial Breathing: Schäfer System.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Artificial Breathing.</span>&mdash;To restore anyone who is
apparently drowned, it is necessary at once to clear the
water out of his lungs, for which purpose therefore you
should incline him face downwards and head downwards,
so that the water may run out of his mouth, and to help
it you should open his mouth and pull forward his
tongue; take off the wet clothing and wrap him in
blankets if possible, and rub and move his limbs as much
as possible to get back the circulation of the blood.
After running the water out of the patient, place him on
his side with his body slightly hanging down, and keep
the tongue hanging out. If he is breathing let him rest;
if he is not breathing, you must at once endeavour to
restore breathing artificially. Lay him flat on his front
with his arm bent and placed under his forehead to keep
his nose and mouth on the ground. Put a folded coat
or pillow under his chest and let his head hang down.
In this way his tongue will not block his throat, and any
water or slime can run out. Then either stand astride
of him or kneel alongside him, and, placing both your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>hands on his lower ribs, press steadily down and forwards
to drive any air out of his body for three or four
seconds, and then ease up to let the air come in again
through the throat, then press down again. Continue
this pressing and easing, counting four to each movement,
until the patient begins to breathe again. Sometimes
this doesn't happen till you have been trying for
an hour or even more.</p>

<p class='c005'>This is called the Schafer method, and can be used
equally well for drowned people or for those overcome
with smoke or gas fumes.</p>

<p class='c009'>[<i>Make the scouts, in pairs, practise above.</i>]</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Smoke or Fumes.</span>&mdash;Accidents are continually
occurring from escapes of gas in mines, sewers, and
houses.</p>

<p class='c005'>In endeavouring to rescue a person, keep your nose
and month well covered with wet rags, and get your
head as close to the floor as possible, and drag the
insensible person out as I have suggested in case of a
fire. Drag your patient as quickly as possible into the
fresh air&mdash;(I say as quickly as possible, because if you
delay about it you are very apt to be overcome by the
noxious gas yourself)&mdash;then loosen all his clothing about
the neck and chest, dash cold water in his face and apply
burnt feathers under his nose. If you find that he is no
longer breathing, then treat him as you would a
drowned person, and try and work back the breath into
his body.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Burns.</span>&mdash;In treating a man who has been burnt,
remove his clothes, not by peeling them off, but by
cutting them with a <span class='fss'>SHARP</span> knife or scissors. If any
part of the dress sticks to the skin from having been
burnt there, do not tear it away but cut the cloth round
it, then as quickly as possible protect the burnt parts
from the air which causes intense pain. The best way
to protect them is by dusting them with powdered chalk
or flour, or by laying strips of lint well soaked in sweet
oil or linseed oil, and covering the whole with cotton
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>wool. Keep the patient warm, and give warm drinks,
such as hot tea, hot milk, or spirits and water.</p>

<p class='c005'>Major John Garroway, M.D., strongly recommends,
instead of flour or oil to stop the pain of a burn, to put
a piece of paper firmly over the wound, and the pain will
be relieved in a few seconds.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Acid Burning.</span>&mdash;A case occurred only the other day
of a woman throwing vitriol over a man's face. This is
an awful acid which burns and eats away the flesh
wherever it touches. Fortunately a policeman happened
to be on the spot at the time and knew what to do. He
at once applied water to wash off the acid, and then
applied flour or whitening to protect the wound from the
air and ease the pain.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Broken Limbs.</span>&mdash;You may get persons with broken
limbs or stunned. In the case of broken limbs you
would learn what to do in passing your ambulance
course, which every boy scout ought to pass before he can
be considered to be fully trained. You would there learn
how to know when a limb was broken, and how to tie it
up between splints made of pieces of wood, rolls of
newspaper or rushes, bundles of twigs, walking sticks,
or any other articles that will make a straight support
for the limb. [<i>Practise this.</i>]</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Pulling in a Dislocated Shoulder&mdash;an actual experience of mine in India.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Bleeding.</span>&mdash;When a man is bleeding badly from a
wound, squeeze the wound or the flesh just above it&mdash;that
is between the wound and the heart&mdash;press it hard
with your thumb to try and stop the blood running in
the artery. Then make a pad with something like a
flat rounded pebble, and bind it over the wound. If
bleeding violently, tie a handkerchief loosely round the
limb above the wound and twist it tight with a stick.
[<i>Demonstrate this.</i>] Keep the wounded part raised
above the rest of the body if possible. Apply cold
water, or ice if possible, wet rags, etc.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Fainting.</span>&mdash;If your patient faints and is pale&mdash;fainting
comes from too little blood in the head&mdash;let him lie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>flat down with head on the ground. If his face is
flushed raise the head&mdash;there is too much blood in it, as
in apoplexy or sunstroke.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Fits.</span>&mdash;A man cries out and falls, and twitches and
jerks his limbs about, froths at the mouth, he is in a
fit. It is no good to do anything to him but to put a
bit of wood or cork between his jaws, so that he does
not bite his tongue. Let him sleep well after a fit.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Poisoning.</span>&mdash;If a person suddenly falls very ill after
taking food, or is known to have taken poison, the first
thing to do is to make him swallow some milk or raw
eggs. These seem to collect all the poison that is
otherwise spread about inside him. Then, if the mouth
is not stained or burnt by the poison, make him sick if
possible by giving him salt and warm water, and try
tickling the inside of his throat with a feather. Then
more milk and eggs and weak tea. If the poison is an
acid that burns, the patient should not be made to vomit,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>but milk or salad oil should be given. The patient
should be kept awake if he gets drowsy.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Blood-Poisoning.</span>&mdash;This results from dirt being
allowed to get into a wound. Swelling, pain, red veins
appear. Fomenting with hot water is the best relief.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Choking.</span>&mdash;Loosen collar; hold the patient's nose with
one hand and with the forefinger of the other, or with
the handle of a spoon try and pull out whatever is stuck
in his throat. By pressing down the root of the tongue
you may make him sick and throw out the obstruction.
For slight choking make patient bend head well back
and swallow small pills made of bread, and sip of water.
Sometimes a good hard smack on the back will do him
good.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>SNAKE BITE.</h5>
<p class='c004'>Fortunately poisonous snakes are uncommon in
England, but if you travel in a colony you are sure to
come across them, and you ought always to know how
to deal with bites from them. The same treatment does
also for wounds from poisoned arrows, mad dogs, etc.
Remember the poison from a bite gets into your blood
and goes all through your body in a very few beats of your
pulse. Therefore, whatever you do must be done
immediately. The great thing is to stop the poison rushing
up the veins into the body. To do this bind a cord
or handkerchief immediately round the limb above the
place where the patient has been bitten, so as to stop
the blood flying back to the heart with the poison.
Then try and suck the poison out of the wound, and, if
possible, cut the wound still more, to make it bleed, and
run the poison out. The poison, when sucked into the
mouth, does no harm unless you have a wound in your
mouth. The patient should also be given stimulants,
such as coffee or spirits, to a very big extent, and not
allowed to become drowsy, but should be walked about
and pricked and smacked in order to keep his senses
alive.</p>

<p class='c009'>[<i>Practise this process in make-believe.</i>]</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>
  <h5 class='c012'>GRIT IN THE EYE.</h5>
</div>
<p class='c004'>Do not let your patient rub the eye; it will only cause
inflammation and swelling, and so make the difficulty
of removing the grit all the greater.</p>

<p class='c005'>If the grit is in the lower eyelid, draw down the lid
as far as you can, and gently brush it out with the corner
of a moistened handkerchief, or with a paintbrush, or
feather.</p>

<p class='c005'>If it is under the upper lid, pull the lid away from the
eyeball and push the underlid up underneath the upper
one. In this way the eyelashes of the lower lid will
generally clean the inside of the upper one.</p>

<p class='c005'>Another way, which every scout must practise, is to
seat your patient and stand behind him yourself with the
back of his head against your chest. Lay a card, match,
or any flat substance under your own thumb on the
upper part of the upper eyelid and then catch hold
of the edge of the eyelid and draw it upwards over
the match so that it turns inside out; gently remove the
grit with a feather or wet handkerchief, and roll the
eyelid down again.</p>

<p class='c005'>If the eye is much inflamed, bathe it with lukewarm
weak tea.</p>

<p class='c005'>If the grit is firmly embedded in the eye, drop a little
oil (olive or castor oil) into the lower lid; close the eye
and bandage it with a soft wet pad and bandage, and
get a doctor to see it.</p>

<p class='c009'>[<i>Practise above.</i>]</p>
<h5 class='c012'>SUICIDES.</h5>
<p class='c004'>I was once travelling in the train in Algeria, a part of
North Africa which belongs to the French, and there was
with me only one other passenger in the carriage, a
French farmer, with whom I got into conversation. He
became very communicative, and told me that if I had
not come into the carriage he would by this time have
been a dead man, as he had got into the train with the
intention of killing himself. So I asked him about his
troubles, and, as he unfolded them to me, I was able to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>tell him various remedies which promised success for him
in the future, for he was chiefly upset over his recent
failures in farming. After we had been going on for
some time, he quite cheered up, and told me that he was
going to get out at the next station, and go back and set
to work in the way suggested.</p>

<p class='c005'>You may have opportunities of saving people who are
thinking of killing themselves. The newspapers give
cases of suicides almost every day, and go into details
of them, because they know that so many people have a
foolish love of reading horrors.</p>

<p class='c005'>Most people at one time or the other of their lives
get a feeling that they will kill themselves; as a rule
they get over it in a day or two, and find that it
comes from nothing worse than an attack of indigestion,
liver, or influenza, or from disappointment, or over-anxiety;
but there are others with weaker minds, who
read these newspaper accounts, and brood over them till
they can think of nothing else. They hug the idea to
themselves, although with horror, and get panic-stricken.
They think too much of their own trouble, without thinking
how the rest of the world is doing.</p>

<p class='c005'>It only needs a sympathising friend to come along and
take command of the would-be suicide, and to give him
something else to think about and to do. You can point
out that suicide does no good to anybody; that it
generally comes from something wrong with the bodily
health, which makes the patient hysterical; that he has
only got to command his own mind firmly, and the
attack will pass off again. Then, if possible, try to get
a Salvation Army officer to see him; he will probably
set him right. In this way you may be able to save
lives.</p>

<p class='c005'>[<i>The Salvation Army have now a department which
gives advice to people who are feeling inclined to kill
themselves. This past year 1125 men and 90 women
have applied to their London office alone; and of these
probably three-quarters would have killed themselves if
it had not been for the sympathy and advice of the officers
who reasoned with them, and found for them ways out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>of their difficulties. The official returns of suicides for
the past year show a much smaller number than
usual.</i>]</p>

<p class='c005'>Where a man has gone so far as to attempt suicide, a
scout should know what to do with him. In the case of
a man cutting his throat, the great point is to stop the
bleeding from the artery, if it be cut. The artery runs
from where the collarbone and breast-bone join, up to
the corner of the jaw, and the way to stop bleeding is to
press hard with the thumb on the side of the wound
nearest to the heart, and pressure should be kept
up as hard as possible until assistance arrives.
[<i>Demonstrate this.</i>] In a case where the would-be
suicide has taken poison, give milk and make him vomit,
which is done by tickling the inside of the throat with
the finger or a feather, or pouring down his throat a
tumbler of water mixed with a tablespoon of mustard or
salt.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the case of hanging, cut down the body at once,
taking care to support it with one arm while cutting the
cord. Cut the noose, loosen all tight clothing about the
neck and chest. Let the patient have as much fresh air
as possible, throw cold water on the face and chest, or
cold and hot water alternately. Perform artificial
breathing as in the case of apparently drowned
people.</p>

<p class='c005'>A tenderfoot is sometimes inclined to be timid about
handling an insensible man or a dead man, or even of
seeing blood. Well, he won't be much use till he gets
over such nonsense; the poor insensible fellow can't
hurt him, and he must force himself to catch hold of him;
when once he has done this his fears will pass off. And
if he visits a butcher's slaughterhouse he will soon get
accustomed to the sight of blood.</p>

<p class='c005'>At Reading, not long ago, two men were severely
reprimanded by the coroner for being afraid to go and
cut down a man who had hanged himself&mdash;they only
ran and fetched someone else, and so he was killed.
What would you have done had you been one of the
men?</p>

<p class='c004'>(See National Health Society's Manual.)</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>To Carry Single-handed an Unconscious
Person.</span>&mdash;Turn patient on his face. Raise him into a
kneeling posture. Kneel, and place yourself across and
under him, so that his stomach rests on your right
shoulder. Pass your right arm between his thighs and
behind his right thigh. With your left arm draw his left
hand forwards under your left, and grasp the wrist with
your right hand; then raise yourself to an erect position.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Stretchers</span> may be arranged in some of the
following ways:</p>

<p class='c005'>(a)  A hurdle, shutter, door, gate, covered well with
straw, hay, clothing, sacking.</p>

<p class='c005'>(b)  A piece of carpet, blanket, sacking, tarpaulin,
spread out, and two stout poles rolled up in the sides.
Put clothes for a pillow.</p>

<p class='c005'>(c)  Two coats, with the sleeves turned inside out;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>pass two poles through the sleeves; button the coats
over them.</p>

<p class='c005'>(d) Two poles passed through a couple of sacks,
through holes at the bottom corners of each.</p>

<p class='c005'>In carrying a patient on a stretcher be careful that he
is made quite comfortable before you start. Let both
bearers rise together; they must walk <i>out of step</i>, and
take short paces. It should be the duty of the hinder
bearer to keep a careful watch on the patient.</p>

<p class='c005'>[<i>Practise these different methods.</i>]</p>
<h5 class='c012'>HOW TO PRACTISE.</h5>
<p class='c004'><i>In practising First Aid it is a great thing to bespatter
the patient with blood to accustom the rescuer to the
sight of it, otherwise it will often unnerve him in a real
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>accident. Sheep's blood can be got from the butcher's
shop.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>Prepare a heavy smoke fire in a neighbouring room
or building (if possible on the first floor), while you are
lecturing in the club room. Secretly arrange with two
or three boys that if an alarm of fire is given they
should run about frightened and try to start a panic.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>Have the alarm given either by getting someone to
rush in and tell you of the fire, or by having some
explosive bombs fired. Then let a patrol, or two patrols,
tackle the fire under direction of their patrol leaders.
They should shut windows and doors. Send scouts into
different parts of the building to see if the fire is spreading,
and to search for people in need of rescue.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>These scouts should have wet handkerchiefs over their
months and noses. "Insensible" people (or sack
dummies) should be hidden under tables, etc.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>Scouts rescue them by shouldering or dragging them
out and getting them down to the ground. Use jumping
sheet, shoot, etc.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>Other parties lay and connect the hose, or make lines
for passing fire buckets.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>Another party revive the rescued by restoring animation.
Another party form "scrum" to help the police
and fire brigade by keeping the crowd back.</i></p>
<h5 class='c012'>GAMES.</h5>
<p class='c004'>"<span class='sc'>Dragging Race.</span>" A line of patients of one patrol
are laid out at one hundred yards distance from start.
Another patrol, each carrying a rope, run out, tie ropes
to the patients, and drag them in. Time taken of last
in. Patrols change places. The one which completes
in shortest time wins. Knots must be correctly tied,
and patients' coats laid out under their heads.</p>

<p class='c004'>Any of you who have travelled much about this country
by train, going for your holidays and so on, know how
two or three hours will take you a good long distance
and six or eight hours will take you to the other end of
England.</p>

<p class='c005'>Well, if instead of hours you travelled for as many
days, even six or eight days would take you a very little
way over our Empire. It would get you into Canada,
but you would want several more days&mdash;not hours&mdash;to
get you across that country. Eighteen days' hard travelling
day and night would get you to India or South
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>Africa, but either of these are little more than half way
to Australia. And all that distance off, across the seas,
on the other side of the world, we have a British country
into which you could put nine Great Britains and
Irelands.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then there are numbers of smaller Colonies or
Dependencies, such as Guiana (nearly as big as the
United Kingdom), North Borneo, New Guinea, Somaliland,
Straits Settlements, Gold Coast, West Indies,
Tasmania, etc., and numbers of islands in ever sea all
over the world.</p>

<p class='c005'>Our Colonies together are something like forty times
the size of the United Kingdom at home.</p>

<p class='c005'>Our fellow-subjects amount to four hundred millions,
and comprise almost every known race. Almost every
known species of wild animal occurs in British territory.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is a magnificent Empire over which the Union Jack
flies, but it is still only at the beginning of its development.
The territories are there, but the people are only
coming. The white population of all these Colonies
only amounts to a little over a quarter of the population
of our crowded little island. We have nearly forty-four
millions here; they have among the colonies a little
over eleven millions.</p>

<p class='c005'>Many of you scouts, as you grow up, will probably
become scouts of the nation, and will find your way to
some of the Colonies to help to push them up into big
prosperous countries. Your scout's training will come
in very useful to you there. But when you go there you
must be prepared to work, and to work hard, and to
turn your hand to any kind of job.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>
  <h5 class='c012'>HOW OUR EMPIRE GREW.</h5>
</div>
<p class='c004'>All those vast Colonies did not come to England of
themselves. They were got for us by the hard work and
the hard fighting of our forefathers.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>America.</span>&mdash;When we first got to America it took Sir
Walter Raleigh, Captain John Smith, and other great
pioneers four or five months to get there in their little
cockleshells of ships, some of them only 30 tons measurement&mdash;no
bigger than a Thames barge. Nowadays
you can get there in five or six days, instead of months,
in steamers of 30,000 tons.</p>

<p class='c005'>Think of the pluck of those men tackling a voyage
like that, with very limited supply of water and salt
food. And, when they got to land with their handful of
men, they had to overcome the savages, and in some
cases other Europeans, like the Dutch, the Spaniards,
and the French; and then they had hard work to
till the ground, to build settlements, and to start
commerce.</p>

<p class='c005'>Hard sailoring, hard soldiering, hard colonising by
those old British sea-dogs, Sir Francis Drake, Sir Walter
Raleigh, Hawkins, Frobisher, and, best of all to my
mind, Captain John Smith.</p>

<p class='c005'>He left Louth Grammar School in Lincolnshire to
become a clerk in an office, but he soon went off to the
wars. After two years' fighting he returned home.</p>

<p class='c005'>He admitted he had gone out as a "tenderfoot," and
had not properly prepared himself as a boy for a life of
adventure; so he set to work then and there to learn
scouting. He built himself a hut in the woods, and
learnt stalking game, and killing and cooking it for himself;
he learnt to read maps and to draw them, and also
the use of weapons; and then, when he had made
himself really good at scoutcraft, he went off to the wars
again.</p>

<p class='c005'>He afterwards became a sailor, fought in some very
tough sea-fights, and eventually, in 1607, he went with
an expedition to colonise Virginia in America. They
sailed from London in three ships, the biggest of which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>was only 100 tons, the smallest 30 tons. But they got
there after five months, and started a settlement on the
James River.</p>

<p class='c005'>Here John Smith was captured by the Red Indians
one day when out shooting (as you have seen by the
play in Chapter I.), and they were proceeding to kill
him when the King's daughter, Pocahontas, asked for
him to be spared. After this the Red Indians and the
Whites got on good terms with each other. Pocahontas
became a Christian, and married Smith's lieutenant,
Rolfe, and came to England. After many strange and
exciting adventures in America, John Smith got much
damaged by an accidental explosion of gunpowder, and
came home ill. He eventually died in London.</p>

<p class='c005'>He was a splendid character&mdash;and always did his duty
in spite of all temptations to let it slide. He was a
tremendous worker, very keen, and very brave. He was
never defeated by any difficulty however great, because
he was always cheery under the worst of circumstances.
His motto was, "We were born not for ourselves, but to
do good to others," and he acted up to it.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>In South Africa</span> we had to drive out the Dutch and
then fight the natives for our foothold, which once gained
we never let go&mdash;and though it has cost us thousands of
lives and millions of money we have got it now.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Australia</span> was got by our sailor-adventurers, like
Captain Cook, outstripping all other nations in their
plucky navigation of immense unknown oceans.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>India</span> was practically in possession of the French
when Clive and Wellesley drove them out, and then in
turn had to fight the hordes of fighting natives of the
interior, and gradually, foot by foot, by dint of hard
fighting, we have won that country for our Empire.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>East Africa</span>, Uganda, and the Soudan beyond Egypt,
and Somaliland have also been fought for and won in
quite recent times.</p>

<p class='c005'>And now in all of these we are spreading the blessings
of peace and justice, doing away with slavery and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>oppression, and developing commerce, and manufactures,
and prosperity in those countries.</p>

<p class='c005'>Other nations could formerly only look on and wonder,
but now they too are pressing forward in the race for
empire and commerce, so that we cannot afford to sit
still or let things slide.</p>

<p class='c005'>We have had this enormous Empire handed down to us
by our forefathers, and we are responsible that it
develops and goes ahead, and above all that we make
ourselves fit and proper men to help it to go ahead. It
won't do so of itself, any more than it would have become
ours of itself. If we don't do this some other
nation will take it from us.</p>

<p class='c005'>If our island of England were attacked and taken,
down comes our Empire like a house built of cards.</p>

<p class='c005'>We have had this danger always, even before our
Empire was a paying one and worth taking. Nowadays
it is much more tempting for other people to take. We
defeated determined attacks of the Dutch upon us in
the old days. The Spaniards with their Armada attempted
to invade us, when, largely thanks to a storm,
we defeated them utterly. Then the French, after a
long struggle to best us, had their invasion stopped by
Nelson's victory at Trafalgar, and their harmfulness
ended by Wellington at Waterloo. The French
Emperor had been so sure of success that he had had
medals got ready to commemorate the capture of England.
And since helping in the defeat of the Russians
in the Crimea we have been at peace with our Continental
neighbours.</p>

<p class='c005'>Let us hope that this peace will remain permanent.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>HOW THE EMPIRE MUST BE HELD.</h5>
<p class='c004'>Peace cannot be certain unless we show that we are
always fully prepared to defend ourselves in England,
and that an invader would only find himself ramming
his head against bayonets and well-aimed bullets if he
tried landing on our shores.</p>

<p class='c005'>The surest way to keep peace is to be prepared for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>war. Don't be cowards, and content yourselves by
merely paying soldiers to do your fighting and dying for
you. Do something in your own self-defence.</p>

<p class='c005'>You know at school how if a swaggering ass comes
along and threatens to bully you, he only does so
because he thinks you will give in to him; but if you
know how to box and square up to him he alters his
tone and takes himself off. And it is just the same
with nations.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is much better that we should all be good friends&mdash;and
we should all try for that&mdash;no calling each other
names, or jeering; but if one of them comes along with the
idea of bullying us, the only way to stop him is to show
him that you <i>can</i> hit and <i>will</i> hit if he drives you to it.</p>

<p class='c005'>Every boy should prepare himself, by learning how to
shoot and to drill, to take his share in defence of the
Empire, if it should ever be attacked. If our enemies
saw that we were thus prepared as a nation, they would
never dare to attack, and peace would be assured.</p>

<p class='c005'>Remember that the Roman Empire 2000 years ago
was comparatively just as great as the British Empire of
to-day. And though it had defeated any number of
attempts against it, it fell at last, chiefly because the
young Romans gave up soldiering and manliness altogether;
they paid men to play their games for them, so
that they themselves could look on without the fag of
playing, just as we are doing in football now. They
paid soldiers to fight their battles for them instead of
earning the use of arms themselves; they had no
patriotism or love for their grand old country, and they
went under with a run when a stronger nation attacked
them.</p>

<p class='c005'>Well, we have got to see that the same fate does not
fall upon our Empire. And it will largely depend upon
you, the younger generation of Britons that are now growing
up to be the men of the Empire. Don't be disgraced
like the young Romans, who lost the Empire of their
forefathers by being wishy-washy slackers without any
go or patriotism in them.</p>

<p class='c005'>Play up! Each man in his place, and play the game!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>Your forefathers worked hard, fought hard, and died
hard, to make this Empire for you. Don't let them look
down from heaven, and see you loafing about with
hands in your pockets, doing nothing to keep it up.</p>

<p class='c004'>John Nicholson was one of the finest among many
fine Britons who helped to rule India. On one occasion
he had a meeting of a number of chiefs at a time when
they were beginning to show some signs of mutiny.
The most important one of these chiefs was called
Mehtab Singh, and just before the meeting he told the
others that he for one was not afraid of the Englishman,
and that he meant to swagger into the room with his
shoes on. (It is the custom in India for natives to take
off their shoes on entering the presence of a superior
just as in England you take off your hat on coming in.)
And he did so. He walked in before them all with his
shoes on.</p>

<p class='c005'>Nicholson did not appear to take any notice of it and
went on with the meeting; but at the end of it, just as
they were all leaving, he suddenly stopped Mehtab
Singh, and ordered the others to wait. He then reprimanded
him for his insolence, and ordered him to take
off his shoes then and there and to walk out with them
in his hand before all the other chiefs. And so he had
to go, hanging his head with shame, disgraced and
humbled by the firmness of the British ruler.</p>

<p class='c005'>This makes a good subject for a display.</p>

<p class='c005'>Scene in a great tent or hall in India.</p>

<p class='c005'>Nicholson (with a black beard), in a dark suit, sitting
on a throne in the centre, with several British and native
officers in red tunics grouped behind him. Native
princes, seated in chairs in semi-circle to either side of
him, all with white socks or bare feet, except Mehtab
Singh, who has black shoes on, put out well before him
for all to see.</p>

<p class='c005'>Nicholson rises, signs to the chiefs that they may go.</p>

<p class='c005'>All rise and bow to him, with both hands to the
forehead.</p>

<p class='c005'>As they turn to go he stops them.</p>

<p class='c005'>"Stay, gentlemen, one moment. I have a matter with
you, Mehtab Singh! Thou camest here intent to show
contempt for me, who represent your Queen. But you
forget that you are dealing with a Briton&mdash;one of that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>band who never brooks an insult even from an equal,
much less from a native of this land. Were I a common
soldier it would be the same; a Briton, even though
alone, amongst a thousand of your kind, shall be respected,
though it brought about his death. That's how we hold
the world. To plot against your master brings but
trouble on yourself. Take off those shoes."</p>

[Points at them.]</p>

<p class='c005'>A pause. Mehtab looks round as if for help, takes a
step towards Nicholson, but catches his eye, and stops.
He sinks slowly on one knee, head down, and slowly
takes off his shoes.</p>

still pointing&mdash;and walks slowly out, shoes in hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>[If a longer scene is required Nicholson might then
address the chiefs on the might of Britain, which, though
a small country, is all powerful for good of the world, and
so he, as representing her, stands one among them for
the good of the whole. And that if they want peace and
prosperity they themselves must be loyal and true to the
hand that is arranging it. Nicholson's words are
splendidly rendered in the poem by Henry Newbolt.]</p>

<h5 class='c012'>SCOUT'S DUTY AS A CITIZEN.</h5>
<p class='c004'>There are two ways by which every good Briton ought
to be prepared to keep up our Empire.</p>

<p class='c005'>The first is by peaceful means as a citizen.</p>

<p class='c005'>If every citizen of the Empire were to make himself a
really good useful man, our nation would be such a
blessing to the civilised world, as it has been in the past,
that nobody would wish to see it broken up by any other
nation. No other nation would probably wish to do it.
But to hold that position we must be good citizens and
firm friends all round among ourselves in our country.</p>

<p class='c005'>A house divided against itself cannot stand. If a
strong enemy wants our rich commerce and Colonies,
and sees us in England divided against each other, he
would pounce in and capture us.</p>

<p class='c005'>For this you must begin, as boys, not to think other
classes of boys to be your enemies. Remember, whether
rich or poor, from castle or from slum, you are all
Britons in the first place, and you've got to keep England
up against outside enemies. You have to stand
shoulder to shoulder to do it.</p>

<p class='c005'>If you are divided among yourselves you are doing
harm to your country. You must sink your differences.</p>

<p class='c005'>If you despise other boys because they belong to a
poorer class than yourself you are a snob; if you hate
other boys because they happen to be born richer and
belong to higher class schools than yourself, you are a
fool.</p>

<p class='c005'>We have got, each one of us, to take our place as we
find it in this world and make the best of it, and pull
together with the others around us.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>We are very like bricks in a wall, we have each our
place, though it may seem a small one in so big a wall.
But if one brick gets rotten, or slips out of place, it
begins to throw an undue strain on others, cracks appear,
and the wall totters.</p>

<p class='c005'>Don't be too anxious to push yourself on to good
billets. You will get disappointments without end if
you start that way.</p>

<p class='c005'>Work for the good of the State, or of the business in
which you are employed, and you will find that as you
succeed in doing this you will be getting all the promotion
and all the success that you want.</p>

<p class='c005'>Try and prepare yourself for this by seriously taking
up the subjects they teach you at school, not because it
amuses you, but because it is your duty to your country
to improve yourself. Take up your mathematics, your
history, and your language&mdash;learning in that spirit, and
you'll get on.</p>

<p class='c005'>Don't think of yourself, but think of your country and
your employers. Self-sacrifice pays all round.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>DUTIES AS CITIZEN-SOLDIER.</h5>
<p class='c004'>A cuttle-fish is an animal with a small, round body
and several enormously long arms which reach out in
every direction to hold on to rocks to enable it to keep
its position and to get food.</p>

<p class='c005'>Great Britain has been compared to a cuttle-fish, the
British Isles being the body and our distant Colonies the
arms spread all over the world.</p>

<p class='c005'>When anyone wants to kill a cuttle-fish he does not
go and lop off one of its arms; the other arms would
probably tackle him and hold him for the cuttle-fish to
eat. No, the way to kill a cuttle-fish is to suddenly
stab him in the heart, and then his arms fall helpless and
dead.</p>

<p class='c005'>Well, we have many powerful enemies round about us
in Europe who want very much to get hold of the trade
in our great manufacturing towns, and of the vast farm-lands
in our Colonies. If they tried to lop off one of
our Colonies it would be like trying to lop off one of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>arms of the cuttle-fish. All the rest would tackle him
at once, as happened in the last war in South Africa.</p>

<p class='c005'>Their only way&mdash;and they know it&mdash;is to stab suddenly
at the heart of the Empire, that is to attack England. If
they succeeded, the whole of the Empire must fall at
once, because the different parts of it cannot yet defend
themselves without help from home.</p>

<p class='c005'>For this reason every Briton who has any grit in him
will <span class='fss'>BE PREPARED</span> to help in defending his country.</p>

<p class='c005'>When Mafeking was attacked by the Boers, the boys
of the town made themselves into a Cadet Corps, and
did very useful work in the defence. It is quite likely
that England will some day be attacked just as
Mafeking was, unexpectedly, by a large number of
enemies.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Cuttle Fish.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>If this happens, every boy in the country should be
prepared to take his place and help in the defence like
those Mafeking boys did.</p>

<p class='c005'>We don't think much of a fellow who is no good at
cricket or football, and who only loafs about trying
(without success) to look like a man by smoking cheap
cigarettes. But we ought really not to think too much
of any boy, even though a cricketer and footballer, unless
he can also <i>shoot</i>, and <i>can drill</i> and <i>scout</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>That is the fellow who is going to be useful if England
is attacked.</p>

<p class='c005'>I hope that before long every eleven, whether football
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>or cricket, will also make itself a good eleven for shooting
and scouting and therefore useful for defence of our King
and country when needed.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the Colonies boys think more of their shooting than
of their games, because the shooting is for their <i>country</i>,
the games for <i>themselves</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Roosevelt, President of the United States of
America, writes:</p>

<p class='c005'>"The qualities that make a good scout are, in large
part, the qualities that make a good hunter. Most important
of all is the ability to shift for one's self&mdash;the
mixture of hardihood and resourcefulness which enables
a man to tramp all day in the right direction, and, when
night comes, to make the best of whatever opportunities
for shelter and warmth may be at hand. Skill in the use
of the rifle is another trait; quickness in seeing game,
another; ability to take advantage of cover, yet
another; while patience, endurance, keenness of observation,
resolution, good nerves, and instant readiness in
an emergency, are all indispensable to a really good
hunter."</p>

<p class='c005'>Roosevelt is not, like certain men I know of, a man
who pays others to do his fighting for him, but, when
America went to war with Spain about Cuba, he went to
the front as a soldier&mdash;like many good Britons did in
South Africa&mdash;and was of greatest value to his side
because he had begun life as a scout.</p>

<p class='c005'>So make yourselves good scouts and good rifle shots
in order to protect the women and children of your
country if it should ever become necessary.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>MARKSMANSHIP.</h5>
<p class='c004'>Lord Roberts, who has seen more of war than almost
anybody alive, knows how terrible a thing it would be if
war came into England, and he urges everybody to join
in preventing it by becoming a good marksman with the
rifle. Thanks to him, all those who have patriotism in
them are taking it up everywhere.</p>

<p class='c005'>The value of non-smoking again comes in rifle shooting.
I used to smoke myself as a youngster, but I had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>to do some rifle shooting, and when in training I found
my eyesight was better when I did not smoke. So I
gave up smoking altogether, and am very glad I did.</p>

<p class='c005'>The boys of the International Anti-Cigarette League bind
themselves not to smoke, in order to make themselves
better men for their country&mdash;that is the best reason for
doing it.</p>

<p class='c005'>I heard another reason given the other day for not
smoking, and that was that St. Paul did not smoke. I
don't suppose he did. Tobacco wasn't invented in his
time.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id007'>
<img src='images/fig128.jpg' alt='Boer Boys Shooting with Crossbows.' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Boer Boys Shooting with Crossbows.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The Boers are all good shots, and so are the Swiss.
In both countries the boys begin learning marksmanship
at an early age by using crossbows. They have much
the same action for the firer as the rifle, since they are
aimed from the shoulder and fired by pulling a trigger
when the aim is taken. Boys trained with the crossbow
have no difficulty in shooting accurately with a rifle
directly it is put in their hands.</p>

<p class='c005'>To be able to shoot well, a great secret is to hold your
rifle properly; if it leans over a little bit to one side or
the other the bullet will fly low over to that side. Keep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>your left arm well underneath the rifle to support it, and
hold it well into the shoulder with your left hand. The
right hand should have the thumb on the top of the stock,
and the forefinger as far round the trigger as you can get it;
then in firing don't give a pull with your forefinger or you
will pull the aim off the target just as you fire; you
should squeeze the woodwork of the rifle between
your thumb and forefinger, and that will fire it with
steadiness.</p>

<p class='c005'>Then when your rifle has gone off, don't throw up the
muzzle in a hurry, but do like all old scouts, continue to
look along your sights after firing to see how much you
have jumped off your aim in firing, and try and correct it
next time.</p>

<p class='c005'>Shooting at a fixed target is only a step towards shooting
at a moving one like a man. Firing at moving
objects is, of course, more difficult, but more real, because
you will not find a deer or an enemy as a rule kind
enough to stand still while you shoot at him, he will be
running and dodging behind cover, so you have to get
your aim quick and to shoot quick.</p>

<p class='c005'>The very best practice for this is always to be aiming
at moving objects with your staff, using it as if it were a
rifle.</p>

<p class='c005'>Aim first at the man, then moving the muzzle a little
faster than he is moving, and fire while moving it when
it is pointing where he will be a second or two later,
and the bullet will just get there at the same time as he
does and will hit him.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>HELPING POLICE.</h5>
<p class='c004'>Boy Scouts can be of special use in assisting the police
in towns. In the first place every Boy Scout ought to
know where the fixed police points are&mdash;that is, where
a constable is always stationed, apart from the policemen
on their beats. He ought also to know where to find the
fire alarm; also where is the nearest fire brigade
station, and the nearest hospital or ambulance station,
and chemist.</p>

<p class='c005'>On seeing an accident, if you cannot help at it you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>should run and inform the nearest policeman, and ask
him how you can help him, whether you can call a doctor,
a cab, and so on. If you hear a policeman's whistle
sounding, run and offer to help him, it is your duty, as he
is a King's servant. If you should happen to see a door
or window left open and unguarded at night, it is as well
to inform a policeman on that beat, but you should on no
account attempt to do detective work by watching people
or playing the spy.</p>

<p class='c005'>If you find a lost child, or lost dog, or any lost property,
you should take them at once to the police station.</p>

<p class='c005'>Sir H. Poland, K.C., had his watch snatched by a pickpocket
the other day. The thief darted away down the
street; but a small boy jumped on to a bike and followed
him, crying, "Stop thief!" till he was caught&mdash;with
the watch on him.</p>

<p class='c005'>Not only can boys help the police, but girls also.
Within the last few months I have noticed three cases
of girls going to the assistance of constables who were
in difficulties with violent men. In each case the girl
got the policeman's whistle and blew it for him until
assistance arrived. These heroines were Miss Edith
Harris at Southampton, Miss Bessie Matthews in
Clerkenwell, and Mrs. Langley at Brentford.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>HINTS TO INSTRUCTORS.</h5>

<h5 class='c012'>GAMES.</h5>
<p class='c004'>"<span class='sc'>Shoot Out.</span>"&mdash;Two patrols compete. Targets:
Bottles or bricks set up on end to represent the opposing
patrol. Both patrols are drawn up in line at
about 20 to 25 yards from the targets. At the word
"fire" they throw stones at the targets. Directly a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>target falls the umpire directs the corresponding man
of the other patrol to sit down&mdash;killed. The game goes
on, if there are plenty of stones, till the whole of one
patrol is killed. Or a certain number of stones can be
given to each patrol, or a certain time limit, say one
minute.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>The Storming OF Badajoz.</span>&mdash;One patrol (French)
mounts on a very strong kitchen-table, or bank, and

to gain possession of the fortress by pulling the

on the ground behind the "rampart." If the defenders
pull a Briton over the rampart on to the ground behind
he is dead. No hitting or kicking allowed.</p>

<p class='c005'>[Badajoz was a Spanish fortress held by 5,000 French
and Spaniards. It was attacked, and stormed, and taken
by the British, who lost 3,500 in the assault, on March
17th, 1812.]</p>

<h5 class='c012'>OUR NAVY AND ARMY.</h5>
<p class='c004'>The British Navy and Army have made our Empire for
us, and if it had not been for their help the Empire
would have been broken up by our enemies long ago.</p>

<p class='c005'>So we must be careful to keep those Services
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>supplied with good men who, like the scouts, must <span class='sc'>Be
Prepared</span> to give their lives for their country at any
time.</p>

<p class='c005'>There are always members of Parliament who try to
make the Navy and Army smaller, so as to save money.
They only want to be popular with the voters in England
so that they and the party to which they belong may
get into power. These men are called "politicians."
They do not look to the good of the county. Most of
them know and care very little about our Colonies. If
they had had their way before, we should by this time
have been talking French; and if they are allowed to
have their way in the future we may as well learn
German or Japanese, for we shall be conquered by these.</p>

<p class='c005'>But fortunately there are other better men in Parliament,
who are called "statesmen"; these are men who
look out for the welfare of the country, and do not mind
about being popular or not so long as they keep the
country safe.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>The British Navy.</span>&mdash;Every British boy should study
the Navy as much as possible, and learn the history of
the different ships, and their power and guns, etc. A
collection of postcard portraits of all His Majesty's ships
is a very interesting one to make.</p>

<p class='c005'>You should know the badges of rank of the officers,
because it is the duty of a scout to salute officers of
His Majesty's service.</p>

<p class='c005'>Badges of rank on the sleeve or shoulder-strap are

</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>Perhaps you may like to know some facts about the
dress of the sailors.</p>

<p class='c005'>The reason they wear that flap collar on their back is
a relic of the time when they wore their hair in pig-tails.
The grease used to come off and spoil their jackets, so
they wore big linen flaps, which could be easily taken
off and washed.</p>

<p class='c005'>They wear a black silk tie round their neck as a mark of
mourning for the death of Nelson at the battle of Trafalgar.</p>

<p class='c005'>They wear three lines of white braid to commemorate
Nelson's naval victories, The Nile, Copenhagen, and
Trafalgar.</p>

<p class='c005'>They wear baggy trousers so that they can easily roll
them up above their knees when they want to wade.</p>

<p class='c005'>Soldiers and sailors tattoo their arms with the idea that
when they are killed in battle they can be identified the
more easily.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>The British Army.</span>&mdash;The Army is made up of&mdash;</p>

<p class='c005'>The Regulars or Active Army, which includes infantry,
cavalry, artillery, engineers, and many other branches of
both white and native soldiers.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Militia at home are to help the Regulars in
time of war.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Militia exist also in most of our Colonies for their
own defence.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Territorial Force is made up of volunteers to
protect the British Isles in case of the Active Army
being called away for war in other parts.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the Army, field-marshals and generals (including
major-generals and lieutenant-generals) wear cocked
hats, with long white cock's feather plumes, and red
tunics or black frock-coats. Their swords are curved
scimitars, with ivory handles. Colonels wear the uniform
of their regiment with crown and star on the shoulder
strap, or, in khaki, on the cuff; majors, one crown;
captains, three stars; lieutenants, two stars.</p>

<p class='c005'>You can tell what wars soldiers or sailors have been
in by the colours of their medal ribbons. These I will
show you later on.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>
  <h5 class='c012'>OUR FLAG.</h5>
</div>
<p class='c004'>Scouts will always salute the colours (or standard) of a
regiment when they pass. There are generally two
such standards, one the "King's Colour," the other the
"Regimental Colour."</p>

<p class='c005'>Men-of-war carry a pennant, <i>i.e.</i>, a long thin flag like
a whip lash. You may remember that the Dutch fleet
under Van Tromp, after defeating ours, carried a broom
at their mastheads to show that they had swept us off
the seas. But when we shortly after defeated them we
put up a whip at the masthead to show that we had
whipped the enemy, and this whip has been carried ever
since by men-of-war.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Royal Navy fly the White Ensign; no one else
is allowed to except yachts belonging to the Royal
Yacht Squadron. The White Ensign is a white flag
with the Red Cross of St. George on it and a Union
Jack in the corner. It is flown at the stern of the ship,
a small Union Jack at the bow.</p>

<p class='c005'>The mercantile navy flies the Red Ensign; or if the
captain of the ship belongs to the Royal Reserve, the
ship flies a Blue Ensign.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Army and Government buildings fly the Union
Jack. Private houses and individuals should only fly
the Red Ensign.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Royal Standard, which shows the Lions of
England, the Harp of Ireland, and the Lion of Scotland,
is only flown when the King is present.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Union Jack is the national flag of England, and
is made up originally of the flag of St. George, a red
cross on a white ground. In 1606 King James I. added
to it the banner of Scotland, which was a blue flag with
a white St. Andrew's Cross diagonal, that is from corner
to corner.</p>

<p class='c005'>In 1801 the Banner of St. Patrick of Ireland was
added to the flag; St. Patrick's Cross was a red diagonal
cross on a white ground, so that the flag now means the
union of England, Ireland, and Scotland.</p>

<p class='c005'>But there is a right way and a wrong way of putting
it up, which all of you ought to know and understand,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>because so very frequently one sees it hoisted the wrong
way up, which literally means that you are in distress;
but people put it that way by mistake or from ignorance.
You will notice that the red diagonal arms of the flag have
a narrow white band on one side of them and a broad one
on the other. Well, the broad one should be to the top
of the flag on the side nearest to the flagpost, that is the
"hoist" of the flag, and towards the bottom of the flag
in the loose end, or, as it is called, the "fly" of the
flag. (See picture, Part 1, page <a href='#Page_29'>29</a>.)</p>

<p class='c005'>It was called a "Jack," either from "Jacques," the
nickname of King James I., who first started it; or,
more probably, from the "jack" or "jacket," which the
knights used to wear over their armour to show which
nation they belonged to. The English knights wore a
white Jack with the red cross of St. George upon it.
This was also their flag.</p>

<p class='c005'>If the flag is flown upside down it is a signal of distress.
If it is half-mast it is a sign of mourning.</p>

<p class='c005'>On going on board a man-of-war, when you reach the
quarter-deck&mdash;that is the upper stern deck&mdash;always
salute the ensign.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the Navy, flags are hoisted at eight o'clock and
saluted. With the Boy Scouts when in camp the same
practice will be observed.</p>

<p class='c005'>Of course you will always rise and salute or take off
your hat on hearing the National Anthem played.</p>

<p class='c005'>The 24th of May, the birthday of the great Queen
Victoria, is "Empire Day," and we all hoist the flag and
salute in special honour of the Empire on that occasion.</p>

<p class='c005'>Remember it is going to be the business of everyone
of you to keep the old flag flying, even if you have to
bleed for it&mdash;just as your forefathers did before you.</p>

<p class='c005'>We have all got to die some day; a few years more or
less of our own lives don't make much matter in the
history of the world, but it is a very great matter if by
dying a year or two sooner than we should otherwise do
from disease we can help to save the flag of our country
from going under.</p>

<p class='c005'>Therefore think it over&mdash;<span class='sc'>Be Prepared</span> to die for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>your country if need be; so that when the moment
arrives you may charge home with confidence, not caring
whether you are going to be killed or not.</p>

<p class='c005'>If your enemy sees that you are bent on either killing
or being killed, the probability is that he won't wait to
oblige you.</p>

<p class='c005'>Don't merely talk, like some gas-bags do, about
shedding the last drop of your blood for your country&mdash;the
difficulty with them, when the time comes, is to get
them to shed the <span class='fss'>FIRST</span> drop of their blood.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Union Jack stands for something more than only
the Union of England, Ireland, and Scotland&mdash;it means
the Union of Great Britain with all our Colonies across
the seas; and also it means closer comradeship with
our brothers in those Colonies, and between ourselves at
home. We must all be bricks in the wall of that great
edifice&mdash;the British Empire&mdash;and we must be careful
that we do not let our differences of opinion on politics
or other questions grow so strong as to divide us. We
must still stick shoulder to shoulder as Britons if we
want to keep our position among the nations; and we
must make ourselves the best men in the world for
honour and goodness to others so that we may <span class='fss'>DESERVE</span>
to keep that position.</p>

<h5 class='c012'>OUR GOVERNMENT.</h5>
<p class='c004'>Of all the different kinds of government in the world,
ours is the easiest and fairest for everybody.</p>

<p class='c005'>Some countries have kings who make their laws for
them whether the people like the laws or not; other
countries make their own laws, but have not a king or a
head who can carry on dealings on equal terms with
other foreign countries.</p>

<p class='c005'>With us the wants of the people are made known
through Parliament. The House of Commons is made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>up of men chosen by the people to make known their
wants and to suggest remedies, and the House of Lords
sees whether these are equally good for all and for the
future of the country; and what they recommend the
King makes into law.</p>

<p class='c005'>When you grow up you will become voters and have
a share in putting members into the House of
Commons.</p>

<p class='c005'>And you will many of you be inclined to belong to
Conservative or Liberal or Radical or other parties,
whichever your father or friends belong to. I should not
if I were you. I should hear what each party has to
say. If you listen to one party you will certainly agree
that that is the only right one, the rest must all be
wrong. But if you go and listen to another you will find
that after all that one is quite right, and the first one
wrong.</p>

<p class='c005'>The thing is to listen to them all and don't be persuaded
by any particular one, for they all tell fibs; they
each want to get into power. And then be a man, make
up your mind and decide for yourself which you think is
best for the country and future of the Empire&mdash;not for
some two-penny-halfpenny little local question&mdash;and
vote for that one so long as it works the right way,
namely, for the good of the country.</p>

<p class='c005'>Many people get led away by some new politician
with some new extreme idea. Never believe in one
man's idea till it has been well considered from all points
of view. Extreme ideas are seldom much good; if you
look them up in history you will see almost always they
have been tried before somewhere. The Socialists are
right in wishing to get money more evenly distributed so
that there would be no millionaires and no paupers, but
everyone pretty well off.</p>

<p class='c005'>But they go the wrong way to work; they want to
fight all other people to get themselves up, instead of
joining in with everybody in doing a great thing for the
whole country by a way which is fair and good for all.
They do not read history, which shows that their plans
have been tried before, and failed, because they made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>life a kind of slavery for everybody, and left the country
an easy prey to another stronger one.</p>

<p class='c005'>More thrift rather than change of government will
bring money to all. And a strong united Empire, where
all are helpful and patriotic will bring us power, peace,
and prosperity such as no Socialistic dream could do.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>OUR KING.</h5>
<p class='c004'>The word Empire comes from an old Roman word
"Imperium," which means "well-ordered rule."</p>

<p class='c005'>And the title Emperor, or ruler of the Empire, comes
from the Roman word "Imperator." The King signs
himself "R. I.," which means "Rex," or King of
England, and "Imperator" or Emperor of India and
the Colonies.</p>

<p class='c005'>Imperator comes from two Roman words, "Im" and
"Parere," which together mean "To prepare for"&mdash;that
is, to <span class='sc'>Be Prepared</span>. An Emperor is one who has to be
prepared to face any difficulty or danger that may
threaten the country.</p>

<p class='c005'>Scouts have in the same way to <span class='sc'>Be Prepared</span> to <i>help</i>
their country in any difficulty or danger; and, therefore,
we are all working to back up our King.</p>

is creeping in among us to-day.</i></p>

<h4 class='c012'>PLAY THE GAME: DON'T LOOK ON.</h4>
<p class='c004'>Every Briton who is worth his salt would like to help
his country:</p>

<p class='c009'>Firstly, if he thought it was wanted.</p>

<p class='c010'>Secondly, if he saw a way by which he could do it.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>THE BRITISH EMPIRE WANTS YOUR HELP.</h4>
<p class='c004'>Our great Empire is to-day to the rest of the world
very much what the Roman Empire was two thousand
years ago. But the Roman Empire, great as it was, fell.</p>

<p class='c005'>"The same causes which brought about the fall of the
great Roman Empire are working to-day in Great
Britain."</p>

<p class='c005'>These words were lately spoken by one of our best-known
democratic politicians, and they have been confirmed
in a recent lecture at Cambridge by Mr. Warde
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>Fowler, as also in various pamphlets and writings. That
they are true is practically admitted by those who have
studied and compared the general conditions of both
countries.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE WAS DUE TO BAD CITIZENSHIP.</h4>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Instruction of Boy Scouts. "Boyhood of Raleigh," after Sir J. Millais. From such instruction was a great character formed.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The main causes of the downfall of Rome is similar to
that which resulted in the downfall of other great
empires, such as the Babylonian, Egyptian, Greek,
Spanish, and Dutch, and that cause may be summed up
in each case as the decline of good citizenship and the
want of energetic patriotism. Each nation, after climbing
laboriously to the zenith of its power, seemed then to
become exhausted by its effort, and sit down in a state of
repose, relapsing into idleness, studiously blind to the
fact that other nations were gradually pushing up to
destroy it. It is easy to push historical parallels too far,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>and whether or not these parallels are real or exaggerated,
they give us food for reflection. The main point
is for us to take the lesson to heart, and see, before it is
too late, that our Empire also be not undermined by
these defects.</p>

<p class='c005'>I am not so pessimistic myself as to think with some
people that we are already so far on the downward
grade as to be in a hopeless condition. On the contrary,
I think that we are only near to the parting of the ways
where it becomes incumbent upon everyone of us who
has the slightest patriotism in him to earnestly help, in
however small a way, to turn the rising generation on
the right road for good citizenship.</p>

<p class='c005'>The aim may seem too big to attain, but most big
things are only got by combination of small efforts. A
coral island is erected by the work of myriads of sea-insects,
the Pyramids of Egypt were the result of co-operation
of thousands of workers.</p>
<h5 class='c012'>BAD CITIZENSHIP IS BECOMING APPARENT IN THIS COUNTRY TO-DAY.</h5>
<p class='c004'>One form of bad citizenship among many is evident
around us on the part of the people themselves, who,
not having been taught to think of the future, or of their
country, allow themselves to come under the despotic
power of a few professional agitators whose living
depends on agitating (whether it is needed or not);
and, blinded by the talk of these men, they attack the
hand that finds the money, till they force employers
to spend fortunes, either in devising machinery that will
take their place and not go on strike, or in removing
their business to other countries, leaving the agitators
fat and happy, and a mass of people unemployed
and starving, and unable to provide for the crowds of
children they continue improvidently to bring into the
world.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>FOOTBALL.</h4>
<p class='c004'>One of the causes of the downfall of Rome was that
the people, being fed by the State to the extent of three-quarters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>of the population, ceased to have any responsibility
for themselves or their children, and consequently
became a nation of unemployed wasters. They frequented
the circuses, where paid performers appeared
before them in the arena, much as we see the crowds
now flocking to look on at paid players playing football.</p>

<p class='c005'>Football in itself is a grand game for developing a
lad physically and also morally, for he learns to play
with good temper and unselfishness, to play in his place
and "play the game," and these are the best of training
for any game of life. But it is a vicious game when it
draws crowds of lads away from playing the game themselves
to be merely onlookers at a few paid performers.
I yield to no one in enjoyment of the sight of those
splendid specimens of our race, trained to perfection,
and playing faultlessly; but my heart sickens at the
reverse of the medal&mdash;thousands of boys and young
men, pale, narrow-chested, hunched-up, miserable specimens,
smoking endless cigarettes, numbers of them
betting, all of them learning to be hysterical as they
groan or cheer in panic unison with their neighbours&mdash;the
worst sound of all being the hysterical scream of
laughter that greets any little trip or fall of a player.
One wonders whether this can be the same nation which
had gained for itself the reputation of being a stolid,
pipe-sucking manhood, unmoved by panic or excitement,
and reliable in the tightest of places.</p>

<p class='c005'>Get the lads away from this&mdash;teach them to be manly,
to play the game whatever it may be, and not be merely
onlookers and loafers.</p>

<p class='c005'>Indifferent citizenship is, and always has been, the
progeny of indifferent government. With it there
arises a crop of doctors to suggest remedies: faddists
on feeding, faddists on Socialism, faddists like myself
on scouting, and so on. Some may be right, some
wrong; all mean well. A certain class of Socialist, for
instance, has come to the fore lately. As a matter of
fact we are all Socialists in that we want to see the
abolition of the existing brutal anachronism of war, and of
extreme poverty and misery shivering alongside of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>superabundant wealth, and so on; but we do not quite
agree as to how it is to be brought about. Some of us
are for pulling down the present social system, but the
plans for what is going to be erected in its place are
very hazy. We have not all got the patience to see
that improvement is in reality gradually being effected
before our eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'>We have a parallel in London just now in the several
railway stations, which, having been found to be out of
date and inadequate for their increased traffic, are being
reconstructed. The Man in the Street has demanded
that they should be pulled down at once, and that afterwards
something better should be devised and built up.
But the management have been wiser; they have recognised
the defects of the old, but before pulling down
they have seen that it would be fatal to stop traffic
during the alterations, and have therefore laid the new
foundations outside the old; they have erected the new
buildings over the effete ones, and have then pulled
these away piecemeal, without interrupting the public
convenience, trade, or routine for a moment.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is easy to pull down; the difficulty is to do so without
damage to the country. We ought to begin by building
up on a sounder foundation before destroying the old.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>OUR FUTURE CITIZENS.</h4>
<p class='c004'>That foundation seems to me to be in the rising generation.
If the whole of our youth were taken in hand
and taught good citizenship, we should have a solid
foundation on which our nation could stand for a long
time to come. But it does not exist at present.</p>

<p class='c005'>We have at the present time in Great Britain two
million boys, of whom one-quarter to one-half a million
are under good influences outside their school walls.</p>

<p class='c005'>(See Sir John Gorst's "Children of the Nation" and
Dr. Macnamara's Report.)</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in15'>2,000,000 boys.</div>
      <div class='line in17'>270,000 under good influence.</div>
      <div class='line in14'>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Remainder = 1,730,000 independent of such.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>The remainder are drifting towards "hooliganism"
or bad citizenship for want of hands to guide them the
right way towards being useful.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is this remainder, nearly two million boys, that we
want to tackle and reduce.</p>

<p class='c005'>They are boys, full of spirit and enthusiasm, approaching
the cross-road, where they take the turn, either to
good or evil. In spite of the improved school teaching
and of the good work of Boys' and Church Lads'
Brigades, Y.M.C.A., and kindred associations, a
large proportion of them are drifting, owing to their
environments, to evil, that is, to becoming "hooligans"
and ultimately "wasters" for the natural term of their
lives; no good to themselves, worse than no good to
their country, just from want of a guiding hand or two
at the turning point of their career.</p>

<p class='c005'>Cannot we find these guiding hands amongst us?</p>
<h4 class='c012'>PEACE-SCOUTING.</h4>
<p class='c004'>Here is one suggestion, at any rate, for a remedy by
which every young man can help his country. I believe
that under the attractive term and practice of "Scouting,"
a large number of boys might be taken in hand in
a practical way, by every young man, without expense
in time or money.</p>

<p class='c005'>By "scouting" I do not mean the military work as
carried on on active service. The scouting we are considering
has nothing to do with this. There is another
form, which one might term "peace-scouting," such as
is usual with frontiersmen of our Empire in every corner
of the world. The pioneers of civilisation in Central
Africa; the ranchmen, cowboys, and trappers of the
West; the drovers and bushmen of Australia; the
explorers of the Arctic and Asiatic regions; the hunters
and prospectors of South Africa; missionaries in all
parts of the uncivilised world; and the constabularies of
North-West Canada, South Africa, etc., are all "peace-scouts,"
men accustomed to live on their own resources,
taking their lives in their hands, brave and loyal to their
employers, chivalrous and helpful to each other, unselfish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>and reliable; <span class='fss'>MEN</span>, in fact, of the best type. These are
the peace-scouts of the Empire, and there is no reason
why we should not train a large number of boys to
follow in their footsteps as regards character and
manliness.</p>

<p class='c005'>A small book which I published a short time ago on
the subject of scouting for soldiers has been so freely
taken up by schools and boys' clubs in England that I am
encouraged to think a system organised for the special
purpose of teaching boys would be acceptable, and I am
still further encouraged in the idea by the fact that a
somewhat similar organisation founded by Mr. Ernest
Thompson Seton in America has had a full and widespread
success.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>MILITARISM.</h4>
<p class='c004'>Two or three prominent authorities have written
deprecating my attempt to "foster among the boys of
Britain a bloodthirsty and warlike spirit."</p>

<p class='c005'>I can only fear that either these gentlemen have not
read the handbooks very carefully, or that I have
expressed myself very badly. The whole intention of
the Boy Scouts' training is for peaceful citizenship.</p>

<p class='c005'>Even if I had advocated training the lads in a military
way (which I have not done), I am impenitent enough to
see no harm in it. I have not noticed that ex-soldiers
are more inclined than other people to commit murders;
all that I see in them, as a rule, is that they have been
taught self-discipline, to sacrifice themselves, if need be,
for others, to obey orders, to be sober, clean, and active,
to make the best of things as they find them, to be loyal
to themselves and their officers. All of which appear to
me to be valuable assets in character for a citizen, whatever
may be his grade or trade.</p>

<p class='c005'>The fact that industrial employers now prefer ex-soldiers
in very many of their departments speaks to the
peace value of a military training. But when an
eminent public man wrote to me that I ought not to
teach boys soldiering because, as he puts it, "he hates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>war like the devil," I felt bound to reply that had he
actually seen anything of war himself, he would, like
most soldiers, hate it <i>worse</i> than the devil. It is for that
very reason that officers almost without exception urge
upon their fellow countrymen to be prepared to defend
their country. It is not that they wish to make the men
bloodthirsty, but it is that they may avert from our own
land that worst of all modern anachronisms&mdash;the horrors
of war, brought on to our own homes, our women and
children.</p>

<p class='c005'>Those who preach shutting our eyes to what is quite
patent to all who dare to look out will themselves be
guilty of tempting the enemy on, of bringing war upon
our country, and of the blood and ruin which will
assuredly follow&mdash;if there is any truth in history.</p>

<p class='c005'>With our rising generation brought up as good
citizens, sensible of their responsibilities and duties in
return for the benefits which they enjoy in a free
country, there would be no danger for the State; but
without manliness and good citizenship we are bound
to fall.</p>

<p class='c005'>Manliness can only be taught by men, and not by
those who are half men, half old women.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>HOW TO TEACH SCOUTING.</h4>
<p class='c004'>The first point is to get men to take up the instruction
of the boys in the art of peace-scouting. The men I
have in my mind as the best qualified and able to do
this are schoolmasters, clergymen, members of the
Y.M.C.A., Legion of Frontiersmen, officers of Cadet
Corps, Boys' and Church Lads' Brigades, Rifle Clubs,
country squires, ex-army officers, telegraph-masters, etc.
These could carry out the training of a few boys apiece,
with very little expense of time or money, by devoting,
say, Saturday afternoons and Sundays to the work,
which, I can promise them, they will find a pleasure
rather than a labour in practice.</p>

<p class='c005'>My suggestion to them would be for each to select a
party of six or eight youths or smart boys, and carefully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>instruct them in the details of peace-scouting. These
boys could then act as assistant instructors or "patrol
leaders" in training each five or six more in the same
art in the progressive course of instruction in this handbook.</p>

<p class='c005'>The instruction is designed for boys of every class.</p>

<p class='c009'>To help the lowest from drifting into hooliganism
and to give them health, character, and aims.</p>

<p class='c010'>To teach the middle class how to work well, and to
be patriotic first and political second.</p>

<p class='c010'>To teach the wealthier to be chivalrous and sympathetic
with their less-favoured brothers, and
ultimately to help in spreading the training.</p>

<p class='c007'>One wants to bring all classes more in touch with
each other, to break down the existing barriers, which
are only artificial after all, and to teach them to give and
take in the common cause instead of being at snarls of
class against class, which is snobbery all round and a
danger to the State.</p>

<p class='c005'>The training is applicable to town or country, indoors
as well as out.</p>
<h4 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Not in Opposition to Existing Organisations for Boys.</span></h4>
<p class='c004'>The scheme is not in any way intended to be in
opposition to any existing organisation. On the contrary,
we want amalgamation rather than rivalry, and
scouting is only intended to be used as an additional
attraction by those in charge of boys' organisations of
any kind. If scouting is taken up by several it may
prove a bond between all. Where such organisations do
not already exist it can supply a particularly simple
and effective one for catching a number of boys who
would otherwise have no hand to guide them.</p>
<h4 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Experimental Camp.</span></h4>
<p class='c004'>I have already made a preliminary trial of the
scheme with a camp of boys of all sorts, from Eton
as well as from the streets, and the results were such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>as to encourage very great hopes as to the possibilities
of the scheme when carried out on a larger scale. A
large island was lent for the purpose by the late Mr.
Charles Van Raalte, Brownsea Island, near Poole.</p>
<h4 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Patrol System.</span></h4>
<p class='c004'>The troop of boys was divided up into "Patrols" of
five, the senior boy in each being Patrol Leader. This
organisation was the secret of our success. Each patrol
leader was given full responsibility for the behaviour of
his patrol at all times, in camp and in the field. The
patrol was the unit for work or play, and each patrol
was camped in a separate spot. The boys were put
"on their honour" to carry out orders. Responsibility
and competitive rivalry were thus at once established,
and a good standard of development was ensured
throughout the troop from day to day. The troop was
trained progressively in the subjects of scouting given
on page 8. Every night one patrol went on duty as
night picket&mdash;that is, drew rations of flour, meat,
vegetables, tea, etc., and went out to some indicated
spot to bivouac for the night. Each boy had his greatcoat
and blankets, cooking pot and matches. On arrival
at the spot, fires were lit and suppers cooked, after which
sentries were posted and bivouac formed. The picket
was scouted by patrol leaders of other patrols and
myself, at some time before eleven p.m., after which the
sentries were withdrawn and picket settled down for the
night.</p>
<h4 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Method of Instruction.</span></h4>
<p class='c004'>We found the best way of imparting theoretical
instruction was to give it out in short instalments with
ample illustrative examples when sitting round the camp
fire or otherwise resting, and with demonstrations in the
practice hour before breakfast. A formal lecture is apt
to bore the boys.</p>

<p class='c005'>The practice was then carried out in competitions and
schemes.</p>

<p class='c005'>For example, take one detail of the subject, "Observation"&mdash;namely,
tracking.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>1.  At the camp fire overnight we would tell the boys
some interesting instance of the value of being able to
track.</p>

<p class='c005'>2.  Next morning we would teach them to read tracks
by making foot-marks at different places, and showing
how to read them and to deduce their meaning.</p>

<p class='c005'>3.  In the afternoon we would have a game, such as
"deer-stalking," in which one boy went off as the
"deer," with half-a-dozen tennis balls in his bag. Twenty
minutes later four "hunters" went off after him, following
his tracks, each armed with a tennis ball. The
deer, after going a mile or two, would hide and endeavour
to ambush his hunters, and so get them within
range; each hunter struck with his tennis ball was
counted gored to death; if, on the other hand, the deer
was hit by three of their balls he was killed.</p>

<p class='c005'>This was our principle for teaching most of the items.</p>

<p class='c005'>Discipline was very satisfactory indeed. A "court of
honour" was instituted to try any offenders against
discipline, but it was never needed. In the first place,
the boys were put "on their honour" to do their best;
in the second place, the senior boys were made responsible
for the behaviour of the boys forming their patrol.
And this worked perfectly well.</p>
<h4 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Results of the Camp Experiment.</span></h4>
<p class='c004'>Since this experimental camp I am more than ever
convinced of the possibilities which underlie the scouts'
training as an educator for boys of all classes. Prepared
as I was for enthusiastic endeavour on the part of the
lads, I was surprised at the effect on their character,
which became visible even in the few days we were at
work. I have not trusted merely to my own observation,
but have had reports from all the parents, bearing out
this conclusion, and giving incidentally some very useful
hints from the parents' point of view. That the boys
enjoyed the training is evident from the letters which I
have had from them, and some of them, at any rate,
have remembered what they learnt. One of the boys&mdash;a
working boy&mdash;writes: "The most important thing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>that a great many boys need to learn is to look at the
bright side of things, and to take everything by the
smooth handle. I myself found that a great lesson, and
I shall never find words enough to thank you for teaching
me it. I have already found it a great help even in
everyday life."</p>
<h4 class='c012'>AUTHORITIES WHO MIGHT FIND THE SCHEME USEFUL.</h4>
<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Lord Mayors and Mayors.</span>&mdash;This scheme might
suggest some useful forms of instruction for the newly-authorised
vacation schools.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Schoolmasters and Teachers.</span>&mdash;This scheme
may, I hope, supply an additional means by which to get
hold of the more unruly boys and to continue out of
hours the practice of the theory which they have learnt
in school. Unruly boys are often the best, once you
have got the right side of them. A Commission on our
schools has recently shown that there is an excess of
book instruction in many of them; possibly if one day
a week were devoted to scouting it would greatly benefit
both the teachers and the scholars mentally and
physically.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Clergymen.</span>&mdash;Clergymen would, I think, find in
scouting a good means of keeping the wilder spirits
among their boys in some kind of order, and also of
arousing the loafers among them into some sort of
energy and interest in life.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Parents.</span>&mdash;Parents might be apprehensive that this
course would lead their sons to imbibe too much the
spirit of adventure and romance, and those whose sons
are wage-earners would fear for their getting unsettled
and wasting their working hours on a useless fad. But
to such I would point out that the course is purposely
designed to teach the boys useful knowledge in a form
that will attract them, and it can be carried out entirely on
Saturday afternoons and Sundays as a counter-attraction
to that Sunday loafing which is the ruin of so large a
proportion of our young men.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span><span class='sc'>Ladies.</span>&mdash;To ladies interested in the care and education
of girls, I think this scheme might supply a suggestion
for an attractive organisation and valuable training.
The experiment of a somewhat similar camp for factory
girls has been such an unqualified success as to lead
one to hope that scouting camps might with advantage
be employed for the rising generation of girls as well as
boys.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Boys' Clubs and Brigades.</span>&mdash;Officers of Boys'
Clubs, Boys' Brigades, Church Lads' Brigades, University
and Public Schools Missions, Cricket Clubs, and Cadet
Corps, but most especially officers of Rifle Clubs, will, I
hope, find in this scheme an additional means of attracting
recruits and of maintaining their interest in their
corps after the first glamour of it has worn off.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Legion of Frontiersmen.</span>&mdash;The Legion includes
many an old scout in its ranks who could at once take
up the instruction of a few boys and youths and do
really valuable work for the Empire, while reviving for
himself many a delightful experience of camp and prairie
life.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Ex-Army Officers.</span>&mdash;Then there are a number of
ex-Army officers, keen and capable, but without occupation,
who would here have a great opportunity for the
exercise of their special gifts and of their prestige among
boys for doing a great national good with very little
trouble and expense to themselves.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Country Squires.</span>&mdash;Members of county families
might do much among their tenants and villagers by
making good Englishmen of their lads, somewhat on the
old feudal lines, by means of scouting.</p>

<p class='c005'>Y.M.C.A.&mdash;Everyone recognises the keenness and go-a-head
manliness of the members of the Y.M.C.A. and
Polytechnics in all parts of the kingdom, and I am convinced
that if these men could see their way to do a
good turn to the rising generation of their countrymen
they would take it up with ardour, especially since this
kind of work is becoming a part of their policy. It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>these gentlemen that I have specially in my eye in suggesting
this scheme, as being the men who can, if they
wish, get hold of practically the whole of the British
boyhood by means of scouting. If every member of the
Y.M.C.A. took a friend as his second-in-command and
six boys as pupils, each of them being required to bring
in another recruit, and then acting as leaders and
instructors to further patrols of six, there would at once
be the commencement of a great "snowball" movement
for good.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>HINTS TO INSTRUCTORS.</h4>
<p class='c004'>I do not in these "Hints" propose to teach my grandmother
to suck eggs, and, therefore, I only address
them to those who have had no previous practice in
teaching boys. They are merely a few notes from my
own experience in that line, and tend to explain some
of the arrangement of details in the Handbook.</p>

<p class='c005'>When you are trying to get boys to come under
good influence you are as a fisherman wishful to catch
fish.</p>

<p class='c005'>If you bait your hook with the kind of food that you
like yourself it is probable that you will not catch many&mdash;certainly,
not the shy, game kind of fish. You, therefore,
use as bait the food that the fish likes.</p>

<p class='c005'>So with boys, if you try to preach to them what you
consider, elevating matter you won't catch them. Any
obvious "goody-goody" will scare away the more
spirited among them, and those are the ones you want
to get hold of. The only way is to hold out something
that really attracts and interests them. And I think you
will find that scouting does this.</p>

<p class='c005'>You can afterwards season it with what you want them
to have.</p>

<p class='c005'>To get hold of your boys you must be their friend;
but don't be in too great a hurry at first to gain this
footing until they have got over their shyness of you.
Mr. F. D. How, in his "Book of the Child," sums up the
right course in the following story:</p>

<p class='c005'>"A man whose daily walk led him down a certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>dingy street saw a tiny boy with grimy face and badly-developed
limbs playing with a banana-skin in the gutter.
The man nodded to him&mdash;the boy shrank away in terror.
Next day the man nodded again. The boy had decided
there was nothing to be afraid of, and spat at the man.
Next day the little fellow only stared. The day after he
shouted 'Hi!' as the man went on. In time the little
fellow smiled back at the greeting which he now began
to expect. Finally the triumph was complete when the
boy&mdash;a tiny chap&mdash;was waiting at the corner and seized
the man's fingers in his dirty little fist. It was a dismal
street, but it became one of the very brightest spots in
all that man's life."</p>
<h4 class='c012'>"BE PREPARED."</h4>
<p class='c004'>In this book I suggest as subjects to teach your boys
such things as Observation of Details and consequent
ability to read character and thereby to gain sympathy,
the value of patience and cheery good temper, the duty
of giving up some of one's time and pleasure for helping
one's country and fellow men, and the inner meaning of
our motto "Be Prepared."</p>

<p class='c005'>But as you come to teach these things you will very
soon find (unless you are a ready-made angel) that you
have to acquire them yourself before you can succeed
with the boys, and when once this is accomplished the
occupation is intensely interesting and improving.</p>

<p class='c005'>You must "Be Prepared" yourself for disappointments
at first, though you will as often as not find them
outweighed by unexpected successes.</p>

<p class='c005'>You must from the first "Be Prepared" for the
prevailing want of concentration of mind on the part of
boys, and if you then frame your teaching accordingly I
think you will have very few disappointments. Do not
expect them to pay great attention to any one subject
for very long until you have educated them to do so.
You must meet them half-way and not give them too
long a dose of one drink&mdash;a short, pleasing sip of one
kind and then off to another, gradually lengthening the
sips till they become steady draughts.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>Thus a formal lecture on the subject which you want
to practise very soon palls on them, their thoughts begin
to wander and they get bored because they have not
learnt the art of switching their mind where they want it
to be and <i>holding it there</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>This making the mind amenable to the will is one of
the important inner points in our training.</p>

<p class='c005'>For this reason it is well to think out beforehand each
day what you want to say on your subject and then bring
it out a bit at a time as opportunity offers&mdash;at the camp-fire
or in intervals of play and practice, not in one long
set address.</p>

<p class='c005'>The lectures in this book are broken up into sections
for this purpose.</p>

<p class='c005'>Frequent practical demonstrations and practices
should be sandwiched in between the sections of the
lectures to hold the attention of the boys and to drive
home your theory.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>CLUBROOM.</h4>
<p class='c004'>Half the battle is to get a room lent for certain nights
in the week, or hired as a club for the scouts, even if
they only consist of a patrol in a village.</p>

<p class='c005'>It must be well lit and well ventilated to prevent
depression and boredom. Pictures of incidents (not
landscapes or old portraits) help to make attraction.</p>

<p class='c005'>A <i>bright</i> fire in winter.</p>

<p class='c005'>Interesting illustrated books and magazines.</p>

<p class='c005'>This can generally be got, furniture, games, etc.,
being given in the first instance by well-wishers.</p>

<p class='c005'>A coffee-bar, commencing on the smallest lines, will
generally succeed, and if carefully managed may
develop a regular income for the upkeep of the clubroom.</p>

<p class='c005'>The scouts themselves must do the cleaning and
decorating, and making furniture.</p>

<p class='c005'>Discipline and good order should be kept inside the
room, and neatness insisted on, Patrol leaders being
made responsible, Patrols taking it in turn to be
responsible for cleanliness and good order of the room
for a week at a time.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>If a bit of ground, even waste ground or a backyard,
is available as club ground so much the better.
You want some place where the scouts can make huts,
light fires, play basket-ball, make tracks, etc.</p>

<p class='c005'>Make the boys themselves manage the club affairs, as
far as possible, by committees, and putting boys in
responsible charge of room, equipment, papers, etc. Sit
back yourself and let them make their mistakes at first
till they learn sense and responsibility. Committee and
annual meetings are very useful for giving self-respect
and responsibility to a number of boys.</p>

<p class='c005'>In America small, self-managed boys' clubs are
becoming exceedingly numerous and popular in all
towns and villages. And the education authorities
help them by allowing them the use of classrooms in the
school buildings in the evenings. This might easily be
done in England too.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the same time, when you can get your own clubroom,
no matter how small, it gives the boys more a
sense of proprietorship and responsibility, especially if
they have taken a hand themselves in making the
furniture, putting up pictures, etc.</p>

<p class='c005'>The clubroom must not be made cosy like a lady's
boudoir, as the boys must be able to romp in it occasionally,
or play handball or "Bang the Bear," etc. So you
want furniture that will pack away into a corner, such as
folding wooden chairs, small tables, and a cupboard in
which to put away books, games, etc., when the romp
comes on.</p>

<p class='c005'>The ideal club is one of two rooms&mdash;one for quiet
games, reading and talking; the other for romping,
gymnastics, etc.</p>

<p class='c005'>The boys must of course pay subscription towards
rent, lighting, furnishing, etc., and the major expenses
must be provided for by means of some joint work by
them, such as garden produce, toys, displays or bazaars
(as described in Appendix).</p>

<p class='c005'>One penny weekly, paid strictly in advance, is
sufficient as a membership subscription.</p>

<p class='c005'>A Penny Savings Bank should be started to enable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>boys to put by money to pay for outings and eventually
to start them in the practice of thrift.</p>

<p class='c005'>A piano is of great help in a club, if you have some
one who can play it, to help out songs, musical drill, war-dances,
etc.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>THE HANDBOOK.</h4>
<p class='c004'>The Handbook is merely intended to offer suggestions,
not to tie instructors to one set course.</p>

<p class='c005'>In such brief space it can only touch sketchily upon
subjects whose detail as instructor you must fill in for
yourself, according to your own imagination and resourcefulness,
to suit your particular local circumstances.</p>

<p class='c005'>I give with each lecture the titles of books bearing on
the subject, to which you can probably get access in your
public library, but you will also find every day as you
read your newspaper fresh things worth cutting out to
use in your lectures. Indeed, if you are ever hard up for
a subject, take the leading news items of the past week,
and explain them in an interesting way with maps,
etc.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have found the value of this also in dealing with
grown-ups in men's clubs, hospitals, etc.</p>

<p class='c005'>The "History of England" by H. O. Arnold-Forster
will at all times give you useful subjects in most
interesting form. For your own information read
"Duty," by Samuel Smiles.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have endeavoured to make the Handbook readable
by the boy himself, since a boy should be encouraged to
read for himself. The worst of it is that the literature
to which as a rule he has access is the cheap and nasty
press with little else than crimes and tragedies and big
football matches to catch his attention.</p>

<p class='c005'>He thus becomes educated downwards instead of being
elevated by good examples to higher deeds.</p>

<p class='c005'>The reading of such books as "Golden Deeds,"
"Deeds that Won the Empire," and so on, are the best
of antidotes, especially if impressed by means of modern
examples, illustrations and lantern slides, and acting the
incidents.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>
  <h4 class='c012'>COURSE OF INSTRUCTION.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c004'>I suggest the following scheme of work, to be altered
according to local circumstances.</p>

<p class='c005'>Give a week to each chapter of the book.</p>

<p class='c005'>On Saturday evening give a lecture with practical
demonstrations and, where possible, <i>with lantern slides</i>,
on the subject of the following week's instruction.</p>

<p class='c005'>Among the worst classes in our slums Sunday is,
unfortunately, perhaps the most unholy day of the week,
but by using it for instruction of the proposed kind I
believe that a good proportion of these lads might be
won and led to better things than the loafing and vice
which are at present incidental to the day.</p>

<p class='c005'>So, for such lads, I advocate using Sunday morning
for teaching the minor practices, and the afternoon for
the consequent scouting exercises.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is true that this suggestion has been criticised in
some quarters, but it has, in the end, been generally
accepted on the plea that it makes for saving souls, for
which work there need be no Sunday closing.</p>

<p class='c005'>The details thus taught could then be carried out and
perfected by the boys individually in their own time
during the week, or by occasional parades when possible
under their patrol leaders, till the following Saturday
afternoon, when you could have a final competition or
games on that subject before starting on the next chapter
that evening.</p>

<p class='c005'>This is only a suggestion on the supposition that you
and your boys are at other work all the week. If you
would thus devote eight Saturday afternoons and
Sundays to this work you will have completed a course
of instruction which will guide a number of boys for life,
and will take them from that present school of loafing
which is to be found, to our great disgrace, at the corner
of every village street in England on Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p class='c005'>If funds are then forthcoming amongst the boys a
camp of a week or ten days, or for two or three week-ends
in the summer, would complete their instruction
and put it to a practical test, while serving as a great
reward for good preliminary work. And it need not be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>very expensive if the boys work for it and save up, as
suggested in Chapter IV.</p>

<p class='c005'>As I have before remarked, the training laid down in
this book is merely suggestive.</p>

<p class='c005'>The instructor should use his own knowledge and
imagination and enlarge upon it.</p>

<p class='c005'>There is much useful technical knowledge which he
might incidentally impart to his boys, either himself or by
getting friends to come and demonstrate (I don't say
"lecture") on such points as the principles of steam or
petrol-engines, or electricity; the work of sailors,
soldiers, firemen, police, and so on; pioneer work such
as bridging with models, road making, building, etc.,
also carpentering, modelling, casting, plumbing,
gardening, etc.</p>

<p class='c005'>Excursions from town into country, and seeing farm
life, mining, fisheries, etc.; or from country to town and
visiting the Zoological Gardens, interesting portions of
museums, picture-galleries, armouries, etc., would be
valuable and popular.</p>

<p class='c005'>With a carefully-laid programme of such items the
scouts' training can be carried out indefinitely in an
interesting way, and on lines that will be of use to them
in their future career.</p>

<p class='c005'>I even advocate taking the boys to a theatre to see
something really good, as a very great inducement to
them to save the money necessary to pay for their seats.
It can be made the first step towards thrift.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>METHOD OF INSTRUCTION.</h4>
<p class='c004'>The way to teach a language is not to bore your pupil
at first with the dry bones of elementary grammar, but to
plunge into fairly deep water with phrases and conversation;
the grammar will then quickly follow of itself.</p>

<p class='c005'>So also with most other subjects of instruction,
including scouting. For instance, take tracking. After
preparing the boys' minds with a few good tracking
yarns and showing a few actual tracks and their
meaning, don't wait till they get bored in trying to learn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>the elementary details, but take them for a real piece of
practical tracking. After they have found out for
themselves how weak they are at it, give them further
"sips" of the elementary part.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>
  <h4 class='c012'>IMAGINATION.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c004'>Boys are full of romance, and they love "make-believe"
to a greater extent than they like to show.</p>

<p class='c005'>All you have to do is to play up to this and to give
rein to your imagination to meet their requirements.
But you have to treat with all seriousness the many
tickling incidents that will arise: the moment you laugh
at a situation the boys are quick to feel that it is all a
farce, and to lose faith in it forthwith and for ever.</p>

<p class='c005'>For instance, in instructing a patrol to make the call
of its tutelary animal (page 355), the situation borders on
the ridiculous, but if the instructor remains perfectly
serious the boys work at it with the idea that it is
"business"&mdash;and once accomplished the call becomes a
fetish for <i>esprit de corps</i> among the members of the
patrol.</p>

<p class='c005'>Bacon said that play-acting was one of the best
means of educating children, and one can quite believe
him.</p>

<p class='c005'>It develops the natural power in them of imitation,
and of wit and imagination, all of which help in the
development of character; and at the same time lessons
of history and morality can be impressed on their minds
far better by their assuming the characters and acting
the incidents themselves than by any amount of preaching
of the same on the part of the teacher.</p>

<p class='c005'>The recent craze for historical pageants is, in reality,
one of the best ideas, educationally, that has come over
us of late years. In places where pageants have been
held, both old and young have learnt&mdash;and learnt for the
rest of their lives&mdash;something of the history of their
forefathers, their town, and their country.</p>

<p class='c005'>Instructors will similarly find it a genuinely useful
practice to make their scouts act scenes from history or of
incidents with which they desire to impress them. Such,
for instance, as "Wilson's last Stand," "The Wreck of
the <i>Birkenhead</i>," "The Sentry at Pompeii," and so on.</p>

<p class='c005'>For this reason a few suggestions for pageants are
given in the Appendix.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is also easy to get up real plays, such as <i>To
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>Parents and Guardians</i> (See Messrs. Samuel French's
List), for which the organisation, rehearsals, and performance
are all good, useful practice, especially in the
long winter evenings. Begin with a small play first,
such as <i>Box and Cox</i> or <i>Area Belle</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>When these performances attain some degree of merit
they might be used as a means of gaining funds.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>RESPONSIBILITY TO JUNIORS.</h4>
<p class='c004'>The great thing in this scheme is to delegate responsibility&mdash;mainly
through the patrol leaders.</p>

<p class='c005'>Have, if possible, a good Second in Command to
yourself to ensure continuity of instruction should you be
unable on occasions to be present yourself, and to
relieve you of many minor details of administration.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>Give full responsibility and show full confidence in
your patrol leaders.</i> <i>Expect</i> a great deal from them,
and you will get it.</p>

<p class='c005'>This is the key to success in scout-training.</p>

<p class='c005'>Foster the patrol spirit and friendly rivalry between
patrols and you will get immediate good results in an
improved standard of the whole. Don't try to do
everything yourself or the boys will merely look on, and
the scheme will flag.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>DISCIPLINE.</h4>
<p class='c004'>Insist on discipline and strict obedience; let them run
riot only when you give leave for it, which is a good
thing to do every now and then.</p>

<p class='c005'>A nation to be powerful and prosperous must be
well disciplined, and you only get discipline in the mass
by discipline in the individual. By discipline I mean
patient obedience to authority and to other dictates of
duty.</p>

<p class='c005'>This cannot be got by repressive measures, but by
educating the boy first in self-discipline and in sacrificing
of self and selfish pleasures for the benefit of others.
This teaching is largely effected by means of example,
and by expecting it of him. There lies our work.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>Smiles gives in his book on "Duty" Baron Stoeffel's
report comparing the discipline of the Germans and the
French before the war, 1870-71, in which he foretold the
victory of the Germans, on account of their superior
discipline; and, in commenting on this, Mr. Smiles
writes:</p>

<p class='c005'>"Can it be that we are undergoing the same process
in England as in France; that the ever-extending tide of
democracy is bearing down the best points of a very
vain-glorious people?</p>

<p class='c005'>"We are a very vain-glorious people.</p>

<p class='c005'>"We boast of our wealth, our naval and military
strength, and our commercial superiority. Yet all these
may depart from us in a very few years, and we may
remain, like Holland, a rich and yet powerless people.
The nation depends on the individuals who compose it;
and no nation can ever remain distinguished for morality,
duty, adherence to the rules of honour and justice whose
citizens, individually and collectively, do not possess the
same traits."</p>

<p class='c005'>Sir Henry Knyvett, in 1596, warned Queen Elizabeth
that the State which neglects to train and discipline its
youth produces not merely rotten soldiers or sailors, but
the far greater evil of equally rotten citizens for civil
life; or, as he words it, "For want of true discipline the
honour and wealth both of Prince and countrie is
desperatlie and frivolouslie ruinated."</p>

<p class='c005'>Discipline is not gained by punishing a child for a bad
habit, but by substituting a better occupation that will
absorb his attention and gradually lead him to forget
and abandon the old one.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>RELIGION.</h4>
<p class='c004'>An organisation of this kind would fail in its object if it
did not bring its members to a knowledge of religion&mdash;but
the usual fault in such cases is the manner in which
this is done. If it were treated more as a matter of
everyday life and quite unsectarian, it would not lose its
dignity and it would gain a hold. It is often the best
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>not to have religious instruction as a special feature, but
to introduce it by "sips" here and there among other
instruction, as I suggest in the chapter on "Chivalry"
and elsewhere in this book.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>CONTINENCE.</h4>
<p class='c004'>In the Handbook I have touched on many important
items of a boy's education, but there is scarcely one
more important than this, which, under advice, I have
relegated from the body of the book to these "Notes for
Instructors."</p>

<p class='c005'>The training of the boy would be very incomplete did
it not contain some clear and plain-spoken instructions
on the subject of continence.</p>

<p class='c005'>The prudish mystery with which we have come to
veil this important question is doing incalculable harm.</p>

<p class='c005'>The very secrecy with which we withhold all knowledge
from the boy prompts him the more readily to
take his own line, also secretly, and, therefore, injuriously.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have never known a boy who was not the better for
having the question put to him frankly and openly. It
can quite well be done without indelicacy.</p>

<p class='c005'>You can warn him that "indulgence" or "self-abuse"
is a temptation more likely to assail him than
any other vices, such as drinking, gambling, or smoking,
and is more harmful than any of them, since it brings
with it weakness of heart and head, and, if persisted in,
idiocy and lunacy.</p>

<p class='c005'>Show him that it is not even a manly vice, but is
everywhere looked down upon with contempt; and that
it can be overcome by determination and strength of
will.</p>

<p class='c005'>The temptation may arise from physical causes, such
as eating rich foods, sleeping on the back in a soft bed
with too many blankets on, or from constipation, or it may
come from suggestion through pictures, stories, or dirty
talk of others.</p>

<p class='c005'>In any case, knowing their danger, these causes must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>be avoided, and the temptation met with a mental determination
to fight it by substituting other thoughts, by
washing in cold water, and by exercising the upper part
of the body, with boxing or arm exercises, to draw away
the blood, and so on.</p>

<p class='c005'>The first occasion will be the difficult one, but once
this is successfully overcome subsequent attacks will be
more easy to deal with.</p>

<p class='c005'>If the boy still finds difficulty about it he should come
and speak quite openly to his officer, who can then advise
him what to do.</p>

<p class='c005'>But for an instructor to let his boys walk on this
exceedingly thin ice without giving them a warning
word, owing to some prudish sentimentality, would be
little short of a crime.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>HINTS TO INSTRUCTORS.</h4>
<p class='c004'>Priggishness or conceit is sure to come to some of
your boys as they find themselves good at various games
or branches of their work. These must be taken down
by the skill and patience of the instructors. Don't get
upset by having one or two of these to deal with, but,
on the contrary, take it as a sporting adventure, and
treat them as interesting subjects. It is far more satisfactory
to turn one unruly character the right way than
to deal with a dozen milk-and-water cases.</p>

<p class='c005'>There are also boys who, though with other boys, are
not of them. These need special individual study and
special treatment, which will avail in almost every case.</p>

<p class='c005'>Boys of rich parents need the training of a scout quite
as much as any poor boy, and should, therefore, be
taken in hand by those who are willing to deal with
them.</p>

<p class='c005'>In "The Boy Problem" it is shown how in the days
of chivalry boys were pages to the esquires in order that
they might learn knightly habits, and then they went to
one of the young knight's castles to learn knightly ideas.
In the same way boys of to-day need contact with
chivalrous young men to make them into noble and
courtly men.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>
  <h4 class='c012'>FORMING CHARACTER.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c004'>Keep before your mind in all your teaching that the
whole ulterior object of this scheme is to form character
in the boys&mdash;to make them manly, good citizens.</p>

<p class='c005'>For the individual it is useful, when describing a
situation, to stop narration at the critical point and ask
a boy what would be his action under the circumstances,
in order to develop quick decision, and so on.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the games it is of the greatest importance to so
arrange that a boy imagines himself running a great
danger in carrying out the mission given him. In this
way he becomes accustomed to taking risks.</p>

<p class='c005'>For the mass it is a useful practice frequently to give
false alarms to see what they do and to accustom them
to face sudden crises. Such alarms, for instance, as
having smoke blown into the room and a sudden alarm
of fire given, or getting a boy to rush in and report that
Johnny Tomkins has fallen from a tree and hurt himself.</p>

<p class='c005'>Instruction of the individual is the only really successful
form of instruction.</p>

<p class='c005'>In teaching your boy to be alert and energetic, teach
him also how to be restful and not to worry.</p>

<p class='c005'>The physical attitude of the natural man, as one sees
it in the savage, is the one to cultivate in the boy in
mind as well as body.</p>

<p class='c005'>The normal attitude of the natural man is a graceful
slackness of body, but with eyes and ears alert, able on
the instant to spring like a cat from apparent inertness
to steel-spring readiness.</p>

<p class='c005'>Study the individual fads and characteristics of your
boys, and, having found them, encourage their development
on these directions; then when advising the boys
as to their future line of life you will be in a position to
direct the square boy to a square hole in the world, and
the round boy to a round one. Don't, as many people
do, make him aim for some sphere for which he is not
really fitted. Aim for making each individual into a
useful member of society, and the whole will automatically
come on to a high standard.</p>

<p class='c005'>One great cause of unemployment&mdash;in all walks of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>life in England&mdash;is the inability of our men to take up
any line other than the one they have first attempted
and failed in. We call a sailor the "handy man" with
admiration, because he seems to be the only kind of
man among us who can turn his hand to any kind of
job. Well, so can anyone if he only has the idea put
into his head and tries it for himself. Our aim should
be, therefore, to make the boys "handy men."</p>

<p class='c005'>But most of all we want to raise the lowest to a
higher place. "Go for the worst" is the motto of the
Salvation Army in its great work. "Our mission is to
the bottom dog" says Colonel Ruston, Mayor of Lincoln.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mr. A. J. Dawson, in his very able articles in the
<i>Evening Standard</i>, has put the question of the loafer in
clear and easy terms.</p>

<p class='c005'>He points out that the very efficient work of our
police in big cities has stopped thieves, but produced a
class of criminally-inclined loafers.</p>

<p class='c005'>"On the Canadian prairie," he says, "if a perfectly
able-bodied man without means were deliberately to
abstain from work for any considerable time he would
die and would cease to cumber the earth." But in
London it is different; a man can loaf for months, or
years, leaning against a public-house&mdash;and they do it
by the hundreds. He assigns two reasons for this:</p>

<p class='c009'>1.  Want of discipline in the lives of those who are
not absolute criminals.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.  Indiscriminate charity.</p>

<p class='c007'>We want to save lads from drifting into this class of
loafer who swells the ranks of the unemployed. The
complaint has recently come from Canada that "No
Englishmen need apply for employment" there. The
subsequent Canadian explanation was to the effect that
the average type of Englishman who came there was
unsuitable, because:</p>

<p class='c009'>1.  He had no idea of discipline.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.  He was generally surly and ready to grumble at
difficulties.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.  He could not be relied upon to stick to a job the
moment he found it at all distasteful.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>These faults are, undoubtedly, very widespread among
us, in all classes of society, owing to want of an education
like that of the scouts. They are the result of
putting self in the first place and ignoring duty or the
interests of others; in other words, they mean <i>bad
citizenship</i>.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>CONCLUSION.</h4>
<p class='c004'>I fear I have stated my hints in very long and formidable
array, such as seem to make the instructor's part a
very complicated and responsible one, but it is not so
when you come to put them into practice. My hints are
like the rows of oil-valves on a motor-car, they look
complicated, but in reality they are intended to drop
their oil automatically and make the wheels run easily.</p>

<p class='c005'>I merely offer this scheme as one among many for
helping in the vital work of developing good citizenship
in our rising generation.</p>

<p class='c005'>Every man of the present generation ought as a
matter of duty to take a hand in such work.</p>

<p class='c005'>This scheme purposes to be one by which any man
can do this, since it requires but little time, expense,
or knowledge; and it is one which attracts the boys and
is at the same time interesting and beneficial to the
instructor himself.</p>

<p class='c005'>If you who read this are a man who has charge of
boys in any way, or if you are one who has so far had
nothing to do with them but who has a desire to see
your country keep her place among the nations for the
good of the world, and would take a hand by training
half-a-dozen boys and putting them on the right road
for good citizenship, you would be doing a great thing
for your country, for your younger brothers, and for
yourself.</p>

  <h4 class='c012'>SCOUTING GAMES, PRACTICES, AND DISPLAYS.</h4>
</div>
<h4 class='c012'>NOTES TO INSTRUCTORS.</h4>
<p class='c004'><i>Instruction in scouting should be given as far as
possible through practices, games, and competitions.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>Games should be organised mainly as team matches,
where the patrol forms the team, and every boy is
playing, none merely looking on.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>Strict obedience to the rules to be at all times
insisted on as instruction in discipline.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>The rules given in the book should be altered by
instructors where necessary to suit local conditions.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>The ideas given here are merely offered as suggestions,
upon which it is hoped that instructors will develop
further games, competitions, and displays.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><i>Several of the games given here are founded on those
in Mr. Thompson Seton's "Birchbark Roll of the
Woodcraft Indians," called "Spearing the Sturgeon"
(Whale Hunt), "Quick Sight" (Spotty Face), "Spot
the Rabbit," "Bang the Bear," "Hostile Spy" (Stop
Thief), etc.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Alarm. "Stop Thief."</span>&mdash;This is similar to the
game of "Hostile Spy," in the "Birchbark Roll of
Woodcraft Indians," by Mr. Thompson Seton. A
red rag is hung up in the camp or room in the
morning: the umpire goes round to each scout in turn,
while they are at work or play and whispers to him,
"There is a thief in the camp"; but to one he whispers,
"There is a thief in the camp, and you are he&mdash;Marble
Arch," or some other well-known spot about a mile away.
That scout then knows that he must steal the rag at any
time within the next three hours, and bolt with it to the
Marble Arch. Nobody else knows who is to be the
thief, where he will run to, and when he will steal it.
Directly anyone notices that the red rag is stolen, he
gives the alarm, and all stop what they may be doing at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>the time, and dart off in pursuit of the thief. The
scout who gets the rag or a bit of it wins. If
none succeed in doing this, the thief wins. He must
carry the rag tied round his neck, and not in his pocket
or hidden away.</p>

<p class='c005'>"<span class='sc'>Track the Assassin.</span>"&mdash;The assassin escapes after
having stabbed his victim, carrying in his hand the
dripping dagger. The remainder, a minute later, start
out to track him by the drops of blood (represented by
Indian corn or peas) which fall at every third pace. His
confederate (the umpire) tells him beforehand where to
make for, and if he gets there without being touched by
his pursuers, over eight minutes ahead of them, he wins.
If they never reach his confederate, neither side wins.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Relay Race.</span>&mdash;One patrol pitted against another to
see who can get a message sent a long distance in shortest
time by means of relays of runners (or cyclists). The
patrol is ordered out to send in three successive notes,
or tokens (such as sprigs of certain plants), from a point,
say, two miles distant or more. The leader in taking his
patrol out to the spot drops scouts at convenient distances,
who will then act as runners from one post to the next
and back. If relays are posted in pairs messages can be
passed both ways.</p>

<p class='c005'>"<span class='sc'>Spider and Fly.</span>"&mdash;A bit of country or section of
the town about a mile square is selected as the web, and
its boundaries described, and an hour fixed at which
operations are to cease.</p>

<p class='c005'>One patrol (or half-patrol) is the "spider," which goes
out and selects a place to hide itself.</p>

<p class='c005'>The other patrol (or half-patrol) goes a quarter of an
hour later as the "fly" to look for the "spider." They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>can spread themselves about as they like, but must tell
their leader anything that they discover.</p>

<p class='c005'>An umpire goes with each party.</p>

<p class='c005'>If within the given time (say about two hours) the fly
has not discovered the spider, the spider wins. The
spiders writes down the names of any of the fly patrol
that they may see; similarly the flies write down the names
of any spiders that they may see and their exact hiding-place.
Marks will be awarded by the umpires for each
such report.</p>

<p class='c005'>The two sides should wear different colours, or be
differently dressed (<i>e.g.</i>, one side in shirt-sleeves).</p>

<p class='c005'>Two or more patrols on each side.</p>

<p class='c005'>Each side will form an outpost within a given tract of
country to protect three flags (or at night three lanterns
two feet above ground), planted not less than 200 yards
(100 yards at night) from it. The protecting outpost
will be posted in concealment either altogether or spread
out in pairs not more than 80 yards apart. It will then
send out scouts to discover the enemy's position. When
these have found out where the outpost is they try
and creep round out of sight till they can get to the flags
and bring them away to their own line. One scout may
not take away more than one flag.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>This is the general position of a patrol on such an
outpost:</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>Any scout coming within 50 yards of a stronger party
will be put out of action if seen by the enemy; if he
can creep by without being seen it is all right.</p>

<p class='c005'>Scouts posted to watch as outposts cannot move from
their ground, but their strength counts as double, and
they may send single messengers to their neighbours or
to their own scouting party.</p>

<p class='c005'>An umpire should be with each outpost and with each
scouting patrol.</p>

<p class='c005'>At a given hour operations will cease, and all will

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>N.B.&mdash;Before making a real article, whether tent, or

and 3/4 inch thick. Cut them both as in Fig. 1.</p>

<p class='c005'>Nail a plank (C) between them at the centre to hold
them in position, and a second similar plank below it.</p>

<p class='c005'>Cut solid block of wood (D) to form the stem or bow-piece,
and a stern board about 2 feet long, 10 inches deep.</p>

<p class='c005'>Join the two bow ends of A and B by screwing them
into the block D.</p>

<p class='c005'>Join the two stern ends by screwing them to each end
of the stern board, and strengthen by screwing stern seat
(E) on to both sides and stern piece.</p>

<p class='c005'>Turn the boat upside down, and screw on planks F F
to form the bottom. Caulk the seams between these by
driving in tow by means of a blunt chisel and mallet, and
paint them with pitch, if necessary, to make them water-tight.
Mark where the seats G G are to come, and nail
pieces of plank to the sides of the boat, reaching to a
height of one foot from the floor, to act as supports to the
seats. Put the seats in resting on these chocks, and
screw them to the sides. Screw a pair of strong wooden
pins to each side of the boat (H H) to form rowlocks.
Knock out plank C, and your boat is ready.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Scouting Race.</span>&mdash;Instructor stations three individuals
or groups, each group differently clothed as far as
possible, and carrying different articles (such as stick,
bundle, paper, etc.) at distances from 300 to 1,200 yards
from starting point. If there are other people about,
these groups might be told to kneel on one knee, or take
some such attitude to distinguish them from passers-by.
He makes out a circular course of three points for the
competitors to run, say about 1/4 mile, with a few jumps
if possible.</p>

<p class='c005'>The competitors start and run to No. 1 point. Here
the umpire tells them the compass-direction of the group
they have to report on. Each competitor on seeing this
group writes a report showing&mdash;</p>

<p class='c009'>1. How many in the group.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. How clothed or how distinguishable.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. Position as regards any landmark near them.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. Distance from his own position.</p>

<p class='c007'>He then runs to the next point and repeats the same
on another group, and so on; and finally he runs with
his report to the winning post.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>Marks.</i>&mdash;Full marks, 5 for each correct and complete
description of a group&mdash;that is an aggregate of 15 marks
for the course. One mark deducted for every ten
seconds later than the first boy handing in his report at
the winning post. Marks or half marks deducted for
mistakes or omissions in reports.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>On Trek.</span>&mdash;Make a trek through Central Africa&mdash;each
scout carrying his kit and food packed in a bundle on
his head; walk in single file with scout 200 yards out in
front and find the way; he makes scout signs as to the
road to follow; make bridge over stream or raft over
lake: corduroy or faggots in boggy ground: leave signs
and notes for any parties who may follow by day or
night.</p>

<p class='c005'>To teach your scouts, individually, ideas of time and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>distance, send each out in a different direction on some
such order as this. "Go two miles to North-north-east.
Write a report to show exactly where you are (with
sketch map if possible, to explain it.) Bring in your
report as quickly as possible."</p>

<p class='c005'>Then test by ordnance maps or otherwise to see how
far he was out of the distance and direction ordered.</p>

<p class='c005'>Send out Scouts in pairs, to compete each pair against
the other. Each pair to be started by a different route
to gain the same spot, finding the way by map, and to
reach the goal without being seen by the others on the way.</p>

<p class='c005'>This develops map reading, eye for country, concealment,
look-out, etc.</p>

<p class='c005'>For judging time. Send out scouts in different
directions, each with a slip of paper, to say how long he
is to be away, say seven minutes for one, ten for another,
and so on.</p>

<p class='c005'>Note down his exact time of starting, and take it again
on his return. Scouts must be put on their honour not
to consult watches or clocks.</p>

how the Kashmir Gate of Delhi was captured by the
British troops during the Mutiny. Lieutenants Home

the column to get into Delhi.</p>

<p class='c005'>The enemy were apparently so astounded at the
audacity of this proceeding that for a minute or two
they offered but slight resistance.</p>

<p class='c005'>They soon, however, discovered how small the party
was and the object for which it had come, and forthwith
opened a deadly fire upon the gallant little band from
the top of the gateway, from the city wall, and through
the open wicket.</p>

<p class='c005'>The bridge over the ditch in front of the gateway had
been destroyed, and it was with some difficulty that the
single beam which remained could be crossed. Home
with the men carrying the powder bags got over first.
As the bags were being attached to the gate, Sergeant
Carmichael was killed, and Havildar (native Sergeant)
Madhoo wounded. The rest then slipped into the ditch
to allow the firing party which had come up under
Salkeld to carry out its share of the duty.</p>

<p class='c005'>While endeavouring to fire the charge Salkeld was
shot through the leg and arm, and handed the slow
match to Corporal Burgess. Burgess succeeded in his
task, but fell mortally wounded as he did so.</p>

<p class='c005'>As soon as the explosion took place, Bugler Hawthorne
sounded the regimental call of the 52nd as a signal to
the attacking column to advance. In this way the troops
got in through the Kashmir Gate, and Delhi was taken.</p>

<p class='c005'>Lieutenant Home was unfortunately killed within a
few weeks by an accidental explosion of a mine he was
firing, otherwise he would have received the V.C.</p>

  <h4 class='c012'>NON-SCOUTING GAMES.</h4>
</div>
<h4 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Useful for Evenings in the Club or in Camp.</span></h4>
<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Nobody's Airship.</span>&mdash;Two patrols sit on two forms
facing each other, knees about a foot from those of
opposite side. A small air-balloon is thrown in, both
sides pat it with their hands to keep it up in the air and
try to send it far over the heads of their opponents. If
it falls to the ground behind one party that party loses
a point. The game is best of five points.</p>

<p class='c005'>"<span class='sc'>Artists.</span>"&mdash;Players sit round a table, each with
paper and pencil.</p>

<p class='c005'>The right-hand one draws a picture, in separate firm
strokes, of an ordinary figure or head&mdash;putting in his
strokes in unusual sequence so that for a long time it is
difficult to see what he is drawing. Each player looks
over to see what the man on his right is drawing and
copies it stroke by stroke. When the right-hand artist
has finished his picture, compare all the rest with it.</p>

<p class='c005'>"<span class='sc'>Target Ball.</span>"&mdash;Indoor cricket with a lawn tennis
ball, small wooden bat, and a disc or small target for
wicket.</p>

<p class='c005'>"<span class='sc'>Circle Ball.</span>"&mdash;A large circle of players throw
lawn tennis ball at one in the centre.</p>

<p class='c005'>The object of the player in the centre is to remain
"in" as long as possible without being hit; if he catches
the ball in his hands it does not count as a hit.</p>

<p class='c005'>Whoever hits him with the ball takes his place.</p>

<p class='c005'>The player who remains "in" longest wins.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Counting the Words.</span>&mdash;Let someone read out half a
page from a book, pronouncing the words with moderate
rapidity. As he reads, let the members of the company
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>try to count his words. The persons who comes the
nearest to the truth in his estimate is judged the victor.
It is astonishing how widely these estimates vary.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Animated Portraits.</span>&mdash;Over a door drape a curtain,
in the centre of which is hung a frame through which
can be thrust the heads of various persons chosen from
those present. These heads are to be attired in such a
fashion as to represent various well-known characters,
such as Christopher Columbus, Queen Victoria, etc. The
audience are to be informed that they are at liberty to
make frank criticisms on these animated pictures for the
purpose of causing a smile. In case the audience is
successful in identifying within a certain time, the person
who represents the picture must pay a fine.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>To Fit.</span>&mdash;Cut a square opening in a pasteboard,
which is placed prominently in front of the room. Distribute
to the members corks of different sizes. Provide
with sharp knives those that are not already provided.
Explain that the task before them is to cut the corks so
that they will fit the square opening, without measuring
the opening, judging entirely by the eye. The one
whose cork fits the best wins.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>City Chains.</span>&mdash;Place the players in two groups facing
each other. Each group must choose a leader, with
whom the members of his side communicate in whispers.
In the centre is an umpire, who, with his watch, gives
each side a quarter of a minute, or less, for their
response.</p>

<p class='c005'>The leader of one side begins by naming a city, such
as New York. Within the prescribed time the leader of
the opposite side must name a city beginning with the
last letter of New York, as Kalamazoo; and so it proceeds,
each leader using the wits of all in his group to
assist his own.</p>

<p class='c005'>When a leader fails to respond in time, the opposite
leader chooses one player from his opponent's side, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>in his turn starts a new chain. The game can be played
also with the names of famous persons, but this is
harder.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>A Memory Game.</span>&mdash;In order to play this game successfully,
it is necessary that the list of words and sentences
given below be in the memory of one of the players, who
acts as leader. This leader, turning to his next neighbour
remarks, "One old owl." He turns to <i>his</i> neighbour,
and gives the same formula. So it passes around the
circle till it comes to the leader again, who repeats it,
and adds the formula, "Two tantalising tame toads."</p>

<p class='c005'>So again it goes around, and again, and each time
the leader adds a new formula, until the whole is repeated,
up to ten. It is safe to say, however, that no
society will ever get that far. All who forget part of
the formula are dropped from the circle. Here is the
whole:</p>

<p class='c009'>One old owl.</p>

<p class='c010'>Two tantalising tame toads.</p>

<p class='c010'>Three tremulous, tremendous, terrible tadpoles.</p>

<p class='c010'>Four fat, fussy, frivolous, fantastic fellows.</p>

<p class='c010'>Five flaming, flapping, flamingoes fishing for frogs.</p>

<p class='c010'>Six silver-tongued, saturnine senators standing
stentoriously shouting, "So-so."</p>

<p class='c010'>Seven serene seraphs soaring swiftly sunward,
singing, "Say, sisters."</p>

<p class='c010'>Eight elderly, energetic, effusive, erudite, enterprising
editors eagerly eating elderberries.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nine nice, neat, notable, neighbourly, nautical,
nodding nabobs nearing northern Normandy.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ten tall, tattered, tearful, turbulent tramps, talking
tumultuously through tin trumpets.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Post</span>.&mdash;This game may be played in a large hall, or
out of doors on the lawn. It is especially adapted to
the juniors, and may be so played as to teach them a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>great deal of geography. The leader either marks with
chalk, or indicates with his fingers, the outlines of some
mission country. Let it be India, for example. A rough
triangle is fixed, and the places of the prominent
mission stations are indicated by marks, sticks, stones,
bushes, or trees, and at each of these places one of the
players is stationed. One player might stand at
Calcutta, one at Bombay, one at Madras, one at Madura,
one at Delhi, etc.</p>

<p class='c005'>The leader then takes upon himself the name of
some prominent missionary of India&mdash;say Bishop
Thoburn; then, declaring that Bishop Thoburn wants
to go from Calcutta to Madras, he attempts to reach
one of those stations while the two occupants thereof
are rapidly changing places. If he succeed in doing
this, the player left out has to take his place as Bishop
Thoburn, and in this way the game proceeds.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Number Groups.</span>&mdash;Give each person present a
number, printed in large type on a card which is pinned
conspicuously on the breast. The numbers range from
10 to 24, and so of course there will be many duplicates.
There is a leader, who begins the game by calling in a
loud voice some number, such as 180. Immediately the
players as rapidly as possible arrange themselves in
groups, seeking to form a group the sum of whose
numbers will equal 180. As soon as a group has been
thus formed it presents itself to the leader, and to each
member of this successful group is given a slip of
paper.</p>

<p class='c005'>As soon as one group has thus formed 180 and been
rewarded, the half-formed groups are dissolved, since
they do not count anything, and the leader calls out a
new number. After this has been tried a certain
number of times, the person that has received the
largest number of slips is adjudged the winner. If you
want to make this game very difficult, use higher
numbers, and attach them to the backs instead of the
fronts, of the members.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span><span class='sc'>Their Weight.</span>&mdash;This contest will make pleasant
material to fill some interval in your socials. Let the
committee previously gather six articles, as dissimilar as
may be in size, shape, and material, but each weighing
a pound. You may take, for instance, a wooden pail, a
tin pan, a piece of lead. Call out different members of
the company, and request them to arrange these six
articles in the order of their weight. Of course, almost
every one will think the large article to be the heaviest.</p>
<h4 class='c012'>BASKET BALL.</h4>
<p class='c004'>This is a game something like football, which can be
played in a room or limited space. A small football is
used, but it is never to be kicked. It is only to be
thrown or patted with the hands. Kicking or
stopping the ball with the foot or leg is not allowed.
The ball may be held in the hands, but not hugged close
to the body, nor may it be carried for more than two
paces. All holding, dashing, charging, shouldering,
tripping, etc., is forbidden; and there is a penalty of a
free throw to the opposite side from the fifteen foot
mark at the net, which forms the goal. The net is hung
up about ten feet above the ground on a post, tree, or
wall, so that the ball can be thrown into it. Opposite
each goal a path of fifteen feet long and six feet wide,
beginning immediately under the basket and leading
towards the centre of the ground, is marked out. At
the end of this path a circle is drawn of ten feet
diameter. When there is a free throw, the thrower
stands inside this circle, and no player is allowed within
it or within the measured path. Corners, byes, and
shies are the same as in Association football; but in
ordinary rooms, with side walls, it is not necessary to
have "out" at the sides. The usual number of players
is four or five a side, and these can be divided into goal-keeper,
back, and three forwards. If there is plenty of room
the number of players could be increased. A referee is
required, who throws up the ball at the start of each half of
the game, and also after each goal. When he throws in,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>the ball must be allowed to touch the ground before it is
played. With four players a side, 7-1/2 minutes each way
is sufficient time; with five a side, ten minutes is the
usual time. A short interval at half time. The net or

</div>

<p class='c009'>Enter advanced scout, left, finding his way by the map,
noticing landmarks, and looking for sign. He
crosses the arena and disappears, right, unless it is
a wide, outdoor space, when he remains at a distance,
squatting, on the look-out.</p>

<p class='c010'>Enter scouts, left, in patrol formation, followed by second
patrol in close formation. Scoutmaster halts them.
One scout semaphores to advanced scout, "We
camp here. Keep good look-out." Patrol leaders
drill their patrols at quick, smart drill for about
three minutes by whistle or hand signal, etc.
(Page <a href='#Page_203'>203</a>.)</p>

<p class='c010'>Camp: Break off and form camp.</p>

<p class='c010'>One patrol makes camp-loom (page <a href='#Page_163'>163</a>) and weaves
a straw mat 4 feet wide 6 feet long, and makes a
lean-to frame (page <a href='#Page_148'>148</a>) or tent frame, with scout
staves, and with the mat form a lean-to shelter.</p>

<p class='c010'>The other patrol makes a camp grate or kitchen
(page <a href='#Page_159'>159</a> or <a href='#Page_165'>165</a>), and lights fire. It then makes
tent frame of staves (page <a href='#Page_371'>371</a>), and makes tent
with canvas squares (page <a href='#Page_371'>371</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>One patrol commences cooking, making dough in
coat, etc. The scouts of the other give themselves
physical exercises, such as body-twisting (page <a href='#Page_229'>229</a>&mdash;page
<a href='#Page_237'>237</a>). Clean teeth with sticks (page <a href='#Page_216'>216</a>).</p>

<p class='c010'>Scouts' War Dance: All fall in and carry out Scouts'
War Dance (page <a href='#Page_56'>56</a>), combined with Follow My
Leader (page <a href='#Page_375'>375</a>). Just towards the end the
dance is interrupted by an</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>Alarm: Shots heard without (right). Alarm signal
given by leaders (page <a href='#Page_203'>203</a>). Smoke-fire made,
alarm signal sent up by one of the patrols, while
the other throws down tent and shelter, cuts lashings,
and distributes the staves to scouts. One
patrol then doubles out in extended formation
(right) towards the firing. Sentry staggers in, and
falls. One scout attends to him. Second patrol
follows the first at a double in close formation. A
scout returns from right carrying a wounded one
on his shoulder; bandages him. Another scout
drags in a wounded one (see pages <a href='#Page_289'>289</a> and
<a href='#Page_306'>306</a>). Firing ceases; both patrols</p>

<p class='c010'>Return, cheerful in having driven off the enemy.</p>

<p class='c010'>One patrol makes stretcher with staves and tent-canvases.</p>

<p class='c010'>The other tidies camp ground, puts out fire, etc.</p>

<p class='c010'>Parade and march off. Union Jack in front. Then
scoutmaster, followed by one patrol; second patrol
carrying one sick man on crossed hands, the other
on stretcher.</p>

<p class='c007'>The whole scene should be frequently and thoroughly
rehearsed beforehand.</p>

<p class='c005'>It must all be carried out as smartly and quickly as
possible, without pauses. Everybody doing something,
helping the others, never standing idle.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is well to have a short explanatory story on the
programme, so that the public understand what it is all
about. Such as this:</p>
<h4 class='c012'><span class='sc'>The Explorers.</span></h4>
<p class='c004'>A troop of scouts, with an advanced scout finding the
way, are exploring a strange country. They halt. A
little drill, and then form camp. While food is preparing
they gain an appetite by physical exercise and
indulgence in a war dance.</p>

<p class='c005'>The alarm is given and signalled. The camp successfully
defended. The wounded cared for, and the
expedition continues on its way.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>
  <h4 class='c012'>TRUE SCOUTING STORIES.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c004'>Interesting examples of the great value of scouting
have, of course, occurred many times. Here are a
few&mdash;unavoidably omitted from a previous part of
"Scouting for Boys."</p>

<p class='c005'>Captain Stigand in "Scouting and Reconnaissance in
Savage Countries" gives the following instances of
scouts reading important meaning from small signs.</p>

<p class='c005'>When he was going round outside his camp one
morning he noticed fresh spoor of a horse which had been
walking. He knew that all his horses only went at a
jog-trot, so it must have been a stranger's horse.</p>

<p class='c005'>So he recognised that a mounted scout of the enemy
had been quietly looking at his camp in the night.</p>

<p class='c005'>Coming to a village in Central Africa from which the
inhabitants had fled, he could not tell what tribe it
belonged to till he found a crocodile's foot in one of the
huts, which showed that the village belonged to the
Awisa tribe, as they eat crocodiles, and the neighbouring
tribes do not.</p>

<p class='c005'>A man was seen riding a camel over half a mile away. A
native who was watching him said, "It is a man of slave
blood." "How can you tell at this distance." "Because
he is swinging his leg. A true Arab rides with his leg
close to the camel's side."</p>

<p class='c005'>General Joubert, who was Commander-in-Chief of the
Boer Army in the Boer War, 1900, told me (some years
before that) that in the previous Boer War, 1881, it was
his wife who first noticed the British troops were
occupying Majuba Mountain. The Boers were at that
time camped near the foot of the mountain, and they
generally had a small party of men on the top as a look-out.
On this particular day they had intended moving
away early in the morning so the usual picquet had not
been sent up on to the mountain.</p>

<p class='c005'>While they were getting ready to start, Mrs. Joubert,
who evidently had the eyes of a scout, looked up and
said, "Why, there is an Englishman on the top of
Majuba!" The Boers said "No&mdash;it must be our own
men who have gone up there, after all." But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>Mrs. Joubert stuck to it and said, "Look at the way he
walks, that is no Boer&mdash;it is an Englishman." And so
it was; she was right. An English force had climbed
the mountain during the night, but by the stupidity of
this man showing himself up on the sky-line their
presence was immediately detected by the Boers who,
instead of being surprised by them, climbed up the
mountain unseen under the steep crags and surprised the
British, and drove them off with heavy loss.</p>

<p class='c005'>An officer lost his field-glasses during some manoeuvres
on the desert five miles from Cairo and he sent for the
native trackers to look for them.</p>

<p class='c005'>They came and asked to see the tracks of his horse;
so the horse was brought out and led about so that they
could see his footprints. These they carried in their
minds and went out to where the manoeuvres had been:
there, among the hundreds of hoof marks of the cavalry
and artillery, they very soon found those of the officer's
horse, and followed them up wherever he had ridden, till
they found the field-glasses lying where they had
dropped out of their case on the desert.</p>

<p class='c005'>These trackers are particularly good at spooring
camels. To anyone not accustomed to them the footmark
of one camel looks very like that of any other
camel, but to a trained eye they are all as different as
people's faces, and these trackers remember them very
much as you would remember the faces of people you
had seen.</p>

<p class='c005'>About a year ago a camel was stolen near Cairo. The
police tracker was sent for and shown its spoor. He
followed it for a long way until it got into some streets
where it was entirely lost among other footmarks. But
the other day, a year later, this police tracker suddenly
came on the fresh track of this camel; he had remembered
its appearance all that time. It had evidently
been walking with another camel whose footmark he knew
was one which belonged to a well-known camel thief.
So without trying to follow the tracks when they got into
the city he went with a policeman straight to the man's
stable and there found the long-missing camel.</p>

  <h4 class='c012'>CORRECTIONS.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c004'>Owing to difficulties in getting out this handbook
punctually in fortnightly parts, I am afraid a number of
inaccuracies have crept in, which I hope you will excuse.</p>

<p class='c005'>These are some of them:</p>

<p class='c009'>Page 45.&mdash;In the colour for the "Wolf" patrol, for
"Yellow" read "Yellow and Black."</p>

<p class='c010'>" 171.&mdash;For "Mr. Seton Thompson" read "Mr.
Thompson Seton."</p>

<p class='c010'>" 188 (line 19).&mdash;For "365 feet" read "365 yards."</p>

<p class='c010'>" 202.&mdash;Sign Y read semaphore</p>

<p class='c010'>" 259.&mdash;For "<span class='sc'>Self-Employment</span>" read "<span class='sc'>Self-Improvement</span>."</p>

<p class='c010'>" 267 (line 19).&mdash;Heading "<span class='sc'>Luck</span>" should be the
heading of the next paragraph, before the
words "If you," etc.</p>

<p class='c010'>" 281 (line 8).&mdash;For "we will" read "you must."</p>

<p class='c010'>" 296 (last line).&mdash;For "Two Scouts in Mafeking"
read "<i>Marksmanship</i>." Colonial boys think
more of their rifle shooting than of their games.
See page 322.</p>

mine" read "An incident in Kashmir. See

<p class='c010'>" 332 (last line but one).&mdash;For "made known" read
"remedied."</p>

<p class='c010'>" 334 (line 21).&mdash;After "we are" insert "or should
be." After King add "for the good of our

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
